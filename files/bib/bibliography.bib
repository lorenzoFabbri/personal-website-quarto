However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) play a large role in the modern approach to causal inference. DAGs describe the relationship between measurements taken at various discrete times including the effect of interventions. The causal mechanisms, on the other hand, would naturally be assumed to be a continuous process operating over time in a cause–effect fashion. How does such immediate causation, that is causation occurring over very short time intervals, relate to DAGs constructed from discrete observations? We introduce a time-continuous model and simulate discrete observations in order to judge the relationship between the DAG and the immediate causal model. We find that there is no clear relationship; indeed the Bayesian network described by the DAG may not relate to the causal model. Typically, discrete observations of a process will obscure the conditional dependencies that are represented in the underlying mechanistic model of the process. It is therefore doubtful whether DAGs are always suited to describe causal relationships unless time is explicitly considered in the model. We relate the issues to mechanistic modeling by using the concept of local (in)dependence. An example using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study is presented.},

  abstract = {Historically, toxicology has played a significant role in verifying conclusions drawn on the basis of epidemiological findings. Agents that were suggested to have a role in human diseases have been tested in animals to firmly establish a causative link. Bacterial pathogens are perhaps the oldest examples, and tobacco smoke and lung cancer and asbestos and mesothelioma provide two more recent examples. With the advent of toxicity testing guidelines and protocols, toxicology took on a role that was intended to anticipate or predict potential adverse effects in humans, and epidemiology, in many cases, served a role in verifying or negating these toxicological predictions. The coupled role of epidemiology and toxicology in discerning human health effects by environmental agents is obvious, but there is currently no systematic and transparent way to bring the data and analysis of the two disciplines together in a way that provides a unified view on an adverse causal relationship between an agent and a disease. In working to advance the interaction between the fields of toxicology and epidemiology, we propose here a five-step “Epid-Tox” process that would focus on: (1) collection of all relevant studies, (2) assessment of their quality, (3) evaluation of the weight of evidence, (4) assignment of a scalable conclusion, and (5) placement on a causal relationship grid. The causal relationship grid provides a clear view of how epidemiological and toxicological data intersect, permits straightforward conclusions with regard to a causal relationship between agent and effect, and can show how additional data can influence conclusions of causality.},

  abstract = {The application of polygenic scores has transformed our ability to investigate whether and how genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to the variation of complex traits. Modelling the complex interplay between genes and environment, however, raises serious methodological challenges. Here we illustrate the largely unrecognised impact of gene-environment dependencies on the identification of the effects of genes and their variation across environments. We show that controlling for heritable covariates in regression models that include polygenic scores as independent variables introduces endogenous selection bias when one or more of these covariates depends on unmeasured factors that also affect the outcome. This results in the problem of conditioning on a collider, which in turn leads to spurious associations and effect sizes. Using graphical and simulation methods we demonstrate that the degree of bias depends on the strength of the gene-covariate correlation and of hidden heterogeneity linking covariates with outcomes, regardless of whether the main analytic focus is mediation, confounding, or gene\,×\,covariate (commonly gene\,×\,environment) interactions. We offer potential solutions, highlighting the importance of causal inference. We also urge further caution when fitting and interpreting models with polygenic scores and non-exogenous environments or phenotypes and demonstrate how spurious associations are likely to arise, advancing our understanding of such results.},

  abstract = {Ageing varies between individuals with profound consequences for chronic diseases and longevity. One hypothesis to explain the diversity is a genetically regulated molecular clock that runs differently between individuals. Large and long enough human studies to test the hypothesis are rare due to practical challenges, but statistical models of ageing are built as proxies for the molecular clock by comparing young and old individuals cross-sectionally. These models remain untested against longitudinal data.We applied novel methodology to test if cross-sectional modelling can distinguish slow versus accelerated ageing in a human population.We trained a machine learning model to predict age from 153 clinical and cardiometabolic traits. The model was tested against longitudinal data from another cohort.The training data came from cross-sectional surveys of the Finnish population (n\,=\,9,708; ages 25-74 years). The validation data included three time points across 10 years in the Young Finns Study (YFS; n\,=\,1,009; ages 24-49 years).Predicted metabolic age in 2007 was compared against observed ageing rate from the 2001 visit to the 2011 visit in the YFS dataset.Correlation between predicted versus observed metabolic ageing.The cross-sectional proxy failed to predict longitudinal observations (R2\,=\,0.018\%, P\,=\,0.67).The finding is unexpected under the clock hypothesis that would produce a positive correlation between predicted and observed ageing. Our results are better explained by a stratified model where ageing rates per se are similar in adulthood but differences in starting points explain diverging metabolic fates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birthweight reflects in utero exposures and later health evolution. Despite existing studies employing high-dimensional molecular measurements, the understanding of underlying mechanisms of birthweight remains limited. METHODS: To investigate the systems biology of birthweight, we cross-sectionally integrated the methylome, the transcriptome, the metabolome and a set of inflammatory proteins measured in cord blood samples, collected from four birth-cohorts (n = 489). We focused on two sets of 68 metabolites and 903 CpGs previously related to birthweight and investigated the correlation structures existing between these two sets and all other omic features via bipartite Pearson correlations. RESULTS: This dataset revealed that the set of metabolome and methylome signatures of birthweight have seven signals in common, including three metabolites [PC(34:2), plasmalogen PC(36:4)/PC(O-36:5), and a compound with m/z of 781.0545], two CpGs (on the DHCR24 and SC4MOL gene), and two proteins (periostin and CCL22). CCL22, a macrophage-derived chemokine has not been previously identified in relation to birthweight. Since the results of the omics integration indicated the central role of cholesterol metabolism, we explored the association of cholesterol levels in cord blood with birthweight in the ENVIRONAGE cohort (n = 1097), finding that higher birthweight was associated with increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower in small versus large for gestational age newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that an integration of different omic-layers in addition to single omics studies is a useful approach to generate new hypotheses regarding biological mechanisms. CCL22 and cholesterol metabolism in cord blood play a mechanistic role in birthweight.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying childhood overweight and obesity are poorly known. Here, we investigated the direct and indirect effects of different prenatal exposures on offspring rapid postnatal growth and overweight in childhood, mediated through cord blood metabolites. Additionally, rapid postnatal growth was considered a potential mediator on childhood overweight, alone and sequentially to each metabolite. METHODS: Within four European birth-cohorts (N\,=\,375 mother-child dyads), information on seven prenatal exposures (maternal education, pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain and tobacco smoke during pregnancy, age at delivery, parity, and child gestational age), selected as obesogenic according to a-priori knowledge, was collected. Cord blood levels of 31 metabolites, associated with rapid postnatal growth and/or childhood overweight in a previous study, were measured via liquid-chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass-spectrometry. Rapid growth at 12 months and childhood overweight (including obesity) between four and eight years were defined with reference to WHO growth charts. Single mediation analysis was performed using the imputation approach and multiple mediation analysis using the extended-imputation approach. RESULTS: Single mediation suggested that the effect of maternal education, pregnancy weight gain, parity, and gestational age on rapid postnatal growth but not on childhood overweight was partly mediated by seven metabolites, including cholestenone, decenoylcarnitine(C10:1), phosphatidylcholine(C34:3), progesterone and three unidentified metabolites; and the effect of gestational age on childhood overweight was mainly mediated by rapid postnatal growth. Multiple mediation suggested that the effect of gestational age on childhood overweight was mainly mediated by rapid postnatal growth and that the mediating role of the metabolites was marginal. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of the involvement of in utero metabolism in the propensity to rapid postnatal growth and of rapid postnatal growth in the propensity to childhood overweight. We did not find evidence supporting a mediating role of the studied metabolites alone between the studied prenatal exposures and the propensity to childhood overweight.},

  abstract = {Both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches are used to understand the metabolic processes taking place in various organisms, from prokaryotes, plants, fungi to animals and humans. Untargeted approaches allow to detect as many metabolites as possible at once, identify unexpected metabolic changes, and characterize novel metabolites in biological samples. However, the identification of metabolites and the biological interpretation of such large and complex datasets remain challenging. One approach to address these challenges is considering that metabolites are connected through informative relationships. Such relationships can be formalized as networks, where the nodes correspond to the metabolites or features (when there is no or only partial identification), and edges connect nodes if the corresponding metabolites are related. Several networks can be built from a single dataset (or a list of metabolites), where each network represents different relationships, such as statistical (correlated metabolites), biochemical (known or putative substrates and products of reactions), or chemical (structural similarities, ontological relations). Once these networks are built, they can subsequently be mined using algorithms from network (or graph) theory to gain insights into metabolism. For instance, we can connect metabolites based on prior knowledge on enzymatic reactions, then provide suggestions for potential metabolite identifications, or detect clusters of co-regulated metabolites. In this review, we first aim at settling a nomenclature and formalism to avoid confusion when referring to different networks used in the field of metabolomics. Then, we present the state of the art of network-based methods for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data analysis, as well as future developments expected in this area. We cover the use of networks applications using biochemical reactions, mass spectrometry features, chemical structural similarities, and correlations between metabolites. We also describe the application of knowledge networks such as metabolic reaction networks. Finally, we discuss the possibility of combining different networks to analyze and interpret them simultaneously.},

  abstract = {This study aims to investigate the association of urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in 2016 on 242 children and adolescents, aged 6-18~years living in Isfahan, Iran. Urinary concentration of mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono (2-ethyl-5-exohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) metabolites were determined. For comparison of means, t test and to evaluate the association of analytes in different groups according to weight ANOVA was used. The correlation was applied to determine the association between phthalate metabolites with age, sex, WC, BMI, and BMI z-score. The univariate and multivariate regression models were used to determine the association of metabolites concentration with BMI z-score and WC. Mean (SD) BMI, BMI z-score and WC were 23.89 (4.41) kg/m2, 1.37 (1.3), and 82.37 (12.71) cm, respectively. There was a significant correlation between boys' age with BMI z-score (p value =\,0.03) and WC (p value =\,0.01), while the corresponding figures were not statistically significant in girls (p value =\,0.48, and 0.4, respectively). Of the total population, 37 participants (15.3\%) were obese. MMP, MBP, and MBzP metabolites were observed in all samples while MEHP, MEOHP, and MEHHP in 99.6, 95.86, and 96.28\% of the studied population. Mean concentration of MMP (64.38~μg/L) and MBzP (268~μg/L) had the lowest and highest concentrations of metabolites, respectively. A significant relationship was observed among all studied metabolites and weight groups (p value ≤\,0.02). After adjustment for potential confounders, all metabolites (except MMP) showed a low-to-moderate positive and significant relationship with BMI z-score (β\,=\,0.17-0.3). A weak to moderate positive and significant relationship was observed between all phthalate metabolites and WC (β\,=\,0.14-0.39). The concentration of phthalate metabolites was much higher in the population living in Isfahan-Iran than in some other populations, indicating a high exposure to contaminants. Therefore, further studies and preventive measures are required for improving the environmental health.},

These exposures, in turn, can affect risks for a variety of human diseases and health outcomes. Climate epidemiology plays an important role in informing policy related to climate change and its threats to public health. Climate epidemiology leverages deep, integrated collaborations between epidemiologists and climate scientists to understand the current and potential future impacts of climate-related exposures on human health. A variety of recent and ongoing developments in climate science are creating new avenues for epidemiologic contributions. Here, we discuss the contributions of climate epidemiology and describe some key current research directions, including research to better characterize uncertainty in climate health projections. We end by outlining 3 developing areas of climate science that are creating opportunities for high-impact epidemiologic advances in the near future: 1) climate attribution studies, 2) subseasonal to seasonal forecasts, and 3) decadal predictions.},

  abstract = {Humans are routinely exposed to mixtures of chemical and other environmental factors, making the quantification of health effects associated with environmental mixtures a critical goal for establishing environmental policy sufficiently protective of human health. The quantification of the effects of exposure to an environmental mixture poses several statistical challenges. It is often the case that exposure to multiple pollutants interact with each other to affect an outcome. Further, the exposure-response relationship between an outcome and some exposures, such as some metals, can exhibit complex, nonlinear forms, since some exposures can be beneficial and detrimental at different ranges of exposure. To estimate the health effects of complex mixtures we propose a flexible Bayesian approach that allows exposures to interact with each other and have nonlinear relationships with the outcome. We induce sparsity using multivariate spike and slab priors to determine which exposures are associated with the outcome, and which exposures interact with each other. The proposed approach is interpretable, as we can use the posterior probabilities of inclusion into the model to identify pollutants that interact with each other. We illustrate our approach's ability to estimate complex functions using simulated data, and apply our method to two studies to determine which environmental pollutants adversely affect health.},

  abstract = {Compositional data comprise the parts of some whole, for which all parts sum to that whole. They are prevalent in many epidemiological contexts. Although many of the challenges associated with analysing compositional data have been discussed previously, we do so within a formal causal framework by utilizing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).We depict compositional data using DAGs and identify two distinct effect estimands in the generic case: (i) the total effect, and (ii) the relative effect. We consider each in the context of three specific example scenarios involving compositional data: (1) the relationship between the economically active population and area-level gross domestic product; (2) the relationship between fat consumption and body weight; and (3) the relationship between time spent sedentary and body weight. For each, we consider the distinct interpretation of each effect, and the resulting implications for related analyses.For scenarios (1) and (2), both the total and relative effects may be identifiable and causally meaningful, depending upon the specific question of interest. For scenario (3), only the relative effect is identifiable. In all scenarios, the relative effect represents a joint effect, and thus requires careful interpretation.DAGs are useful for considering causal effects for compositional data. In all analyses involving compositional data, researchers should explicitly consider and declare which causal effect is sought and how it should be interpreted.},

In health applications, this difference can be understood in terms of the difference between prognosis (prediction) and prevention/treatment (causal explanation). Nevertheless, these two concepts are often conflated in practice. We use the framework of generalized linear models (GLMs) to illustrate that predictive and causal queries require distinct processes for their application and subsequent interpretation of results. In particular, we identify five primary ways in which GLMs for prediction differ from GLMs for causal inference: (i) the covariates that should be considered for inclusion in (and possibly exclusion from) the model; (ii) how a suitable set of covariates to include in the model is determined; (iii) which covariates are ultimately selected and what functional form (i.e. parameterization) they take; (iv) how the model is evaluated; and (v) how the model is interpreted. We outline some of the potential consequences of failing to acknowledge and respect these differences, and additionally consider the implications for machine learning (ML) methods. We then conclude with three recommendations that we hope will help ensure that both prediction and causal modelling are used appropriately and to greatest effect in health research.},

  abstract = {'Unexplained residuals' models have been used within lifecourse epidemiology to model an exposure measured longitudinally at several time points in relation to a distal outcome. It has been claimed that these models have several advantages, including: the ability to estimate multiple total causal effects in a single model, and additional insight into the effect on the outcome of greater-than-expected increases in the exposure compared to traditional regression methods. We evaluate these properties and prove mathematically how adjustment for confounding variables must be made within this modelling framework. Importantly, we explicitly place unexplained residual models in a causal framework using directed acyclic graphs. This allows for theoretical justification of appropriate confounder adjustment and provides a framework for extending our results to more complex scenarios than those examined in this paper. We also discuss several interpretational issues relating to unexplained residual models within a causal framework. We argue that unexplained residual models offer no additional insights compared to traditional regression methods, and, in fact, are more challenging to implement; moreover, they artificially reduce estimated standard errors. Consequently, we conclude that unexplained residual models, if used, must be implemented with great care.},

In line with the regulatory framework implemented within the European Union (EU) to reduce the levels of endocrine disruptors (EDs) for consumers, new and effective methods for ED testing are needed. The OBERON project will build an integrated testing strategy (ITS) to detect ED-related metabolic disorders by developing, improving and validating a battery of test systems. It will be based on the concept of an integrated approach for testing and assessment (IATA). OBERON will combine (1) experimental methods (in vitro, e.g., using 2D and 3D human-derived cells and tissues, and in vivo, i.e., using zebrafish at different stages), (2) high throughput omics technologies, (3) epidemiology and human biomonitoring studies and (4) advanced computational models (in silico and systems biology) on functional endpoints related to metabolism. Such interdisciplinary framework will help in deciphering EDs based on a mechanistic understanding of toxicity by providing and making available more effective alternative test methods relevant for human health that are in line with regulatory needs. Data generated in OBERON will also allow the development of novel adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). The assays will be pre-validated in order to select the test systems that will show acceptable performance in terms of relevance for the second step of the validation process, i.e., the inter-laboratory validation as ring tests. Therefore, the aim of the OBERON project is to support the organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) conceptual framework for testing and assessment of single and/or mixture of EDs by developing specific assays not covered by the current tests, and to propose an IATA for ED-related metabolic disorder detection, which will be submitted to the Joint Research Center (JRC) and OECD community.},

  abstract = {Summary: Advances in technologies to measure a broad set of exposures have led to a range of exposome research efforts. Yet, these efforts have insufficiently integrated methods that incorporate genetic data to strengthen causal inference, despite evidence that many exposome-associated phenotypes are heritable. Objective: We demonstrate how integration of methods and study designs that incorporate genetic data can strengthen causal inference in exposomics research by helping address six challenges: reverse causation and unmeasured confounding, comprehensive examination of phenotypic effects, low efficiency, replication, multilevel data integration, and characterization of tissue-specific effects. Examples are drawn from studies of biomarkers and health behaviors, exposure domains where the causal inference methods we describe are most often applied. Discussion: Technological, computational, and statistical advances in genotyping, imputation, and analysis, combined with broad data sharing and cross-study collaborations, offer multiple opportunities to strengthen causal inference in exposomics research. Full application of these opportunities will require an expanded understanding of genetic variants that predict exposome phenotypes as well as an appreciation that the utility of genetic variants for causal inference will vary by exposure and may depend on large sample sizes. However, several of these challenges can be addressed through international scientific collaborations that prioritize data sharing. Ultimately, we anticipate that efforts to better integrate methods that incorporate genetic data will extend the reach of exposomics research by helping address the challenges of comprehensively measuring the exposome and its health effects across studies, the life course, and in varied contexts and diverse populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9098},

  abstract = {Hundreds of studies show that air pollution affects health in the immediate shortrun, and play a key role in setting air quality standards. Yet, estimated effect sizes vary widely across studies. Analyzing the results published in epidemiology and economics, we first find that a substantial share of estimates are likely to be inflated due publication bias and a lack of statistical power. Second, we run real data simulations to identify the design parameters causing these issues. We show that this exaggeration may be driven by the small number of exogenous shocks leveraged, by the limited strength of the instruments used or by sparse outcomes. These concerns likely extend to studies in other fields relying on comparable research designs. Our paper provides a principled workflow to evaluate and avoid the risk of exaggeration when conducting an observational study.},

We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce a highly efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm for maximum a posteriori estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

(Am J Epidemiol. 2023;192(9):1536–1544) discuss a critical topic in public health and beyond: obtaining valid statistical inference when using machine learning in causal research. In doing so, the authors review recent prominent methodological work and recommend: 1) doubly robust estimators, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE); 2) ensemble methods, such as Super Learner, to combine predictions from a diverse library of algorithms; and 3) sample splitting to reduce bias and improve inference. We largely agree with these recommendations. In this commentary, we highlight the critical importance of the Super Learner library. Specifically, in both simulation settings considered by the authors, we demonstrate that reductions in bias and improvements in confidence-interval coverage can be achieved using TMLE without sample splitting and with a Super Learner library that excludes tree-based methods but includes regression splines. Whether extremely data-adaptive algorithms and sample splitting are needed depends on the specific problem and should be informed by simulations reflecting the specific application. More research is needed on practical recommendations for selecting among these options in common situations arising in epidemiology.},

As a case study, we consider recent findings that suggest human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is less effective against HPV-associated disease among girls living with HIV compared to girls without HIV. OBJECTIVES: To understand the relationship between HIV status and HPV vaccine effectiveness, it is important to outline the key assumptions of the causal mechanisms before designing a study to investigate the effect of the HPV vaccine in girls living with HIV infection. METHODS: We present a causal graph to describe our assumptions and proposed approach to explore this relationship. We hope to obtain feedback on our assumptions before data analysis and exemplify the process for designing causal graphs to inform an etiologic study. CONCLUSION: The approach we lay out in this paper may be useful for other researchers who have an interest in using causal graphs to describe and assess assumptions in their own research before undergoing data collection and/or analysis.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: As an exploratory study, the effects of triclosan on the inflammatory gene expression profile were assessed ex vivo using peripheral whole blood samples from eight periodontally healthy donors. Ten-millilitres whole blood aliquots were incubated 2 h with 0.3 microg/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without 0.5 microg/ml triclosan. Affymetrix microarray gene expression profiles from isolated leucocytes and pathway-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays were used to investigate changes in expression of target cytokines and cell signalling molecules. RESULTS: Ex vivo human whole blood assays indicated that triclosan significantly down-regulated the LPS-stimulated expression of Toll-like receptor signalling molecules and other multiple inflammatory molecules including IL-1 and IL-6 and the dampening of signals that activate the T-helper type 1 acquired immune response via suppression of CD70 with concomitant up-regulation of growth factors related to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2 and BMP6 synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-inflammatory effects were found in this exploratory survey, including suppression of microbial-pathogen recognition pathway molecules and the suppression of acute and chronic mediators of inflammation.},

We integrated Mendelian randomisation (MR) and metabolomics data to probe the effect of 46 maternal metabolic traits on offspring birthweight (N = 210,267). We implemented univariable two-sample MR (UVMR) to identify candidate metabolic traits affecting offspring birthweight. We then applied two-sample multivariable MR (MVMR) to jointly estimate the potential direct causal effect for each candidate maternal metabolic trait. In the main analyses, UVMR indicated that higher maternal glucose was related to higher offspring birthweight (0.328 SD difference in mean birthweight per 1 SD difference in glucose (95\% CI: 0.104, 0.414)), as were maternal glutamine (0.089 (95\% CI: 0.033, 0.144)) and alanine (0.137 (95\% CI: 0.036, 0.239)). In additional analyses, UVMR estimates were broadly consistent when selecting instruments from an independent data source, albeit imprecise for glutamine and alanine, and were attenuated for alanine when using other UVMR methods. MVMR results supported independent effects of these metabolites, with effect estimates consistent with those seen with the UVMR results. Among the remaining 43 metabolic traits, UVMR estimates indicated a null effect for most lipid-related traits and a high degree of uncertainty for other amino acids and ketone bodies. Our findings suggest that maternal gestational glucose and glutamine are causally related to offspring birthweight.},

With an increase in the size of these datasets, a network graph analysis and visualization of the correlation structure is difficult to interpret. While co-regulatory genes databases have been developed, a similar database for metabolites and chemicals have not been developed yet. We have developed the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics - Chemical Correlation Database (IDSL.CCDB), as a systematic catalogue of inter-chemical correlation in publicly available metabolomics and exposomics studies. The database has been provided via an online interface to create single compound-centric views that are clear, readable and meaningful. We have demonstrated various applications of the database to explore: 1) the chemicals from a chemical class such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and tobacco smoke related metabolites; 2) xenobiotic metabolites such as caffeine and acetaminophen; 3) endogenous metabolites (acyl-carnitines); and 4) unannotated peaks for PFAS. The database has a rich collection of 36 human studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and high-quality untargeted metabolomics datasets. IDSL.CCDB is supported by a simple, interactive and user-friendly web-interface to retrieve and visualize the inter-chemical correlation data. The IDSL.CCDB has the potential to be a key computational resource in metabolomics and exposomics facilitating the expansion of our understanding about biological and chemical relationships among metabolites and chemical exposures in the human body.

  abstract = {Mediation analysis offers an essential and rapidly expanding tool in environmental health studies to investigate the contribution of environmental factors towards observed associations between risk factors and health outcomes. When evaluating environmental factors, there may be particular interest in quantifying the impact of exposure to environmental mixtures on human health. In this context, evaluating the joint effect of multiple chemicals or pollutants, rather than individual examination, allows accurate identification of risk factors, assessment of interactions, and ultimately development of more targeted public health interventions. While mediation analysis has been extended to incorporate several methodological complexities specific to environmental factors, little attention has been given to integrating the analysis of environmental mixtures. The aim of this review is to present some of the available methods for environmental mixtures, and discuss how these methods can be integrated within a mediation analysis framework. By incorporating these methods into a mediation framework, investigators will be able to evaluate the contribution of environmental mixtures as mediators of exposure-outcome associations, based on methodologies that are currently available. While standard regression-based methods for multiple mediators can be used, these can easily become unstable as the number of mixture components increases. Summary and classification methods, or hierarchical modeling, can reduce the number of mediators by creating scores or possibly uncorrelated subgroups. This approach allows retrieving indirect effects due to the mixture or to a specific subgroup, but makes identification of component-specific effects and interactions complicated. Finally, one can use various approaches for analyzing mixtures in a two-stage fashion, selecting relevant mediators to be included in the final model. We focused this review on techniques that have been presented to the environmental health community and that can be conducted with major statistical software. We encourage researchers to move beyond the evaluation of one environmental factor at a time to the assessment of the joint effects of environmental mixtures when a mediation model is of interest. Available methods target different aspects related to environmental mixtures and the choice of the suitable approach will depend on data structures and the research question of interest.},

We conducted a study to explore associations between environmental chemicals and endogenous molecules using Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) of non-targeted metabolomics data measured in a cohort of California women firefighters and office workers. GGMs revealed many exposure-metabolite associations, including that exposures to mono-hydroxyisononyl phthalate, ethyl paraben and 4-ethylbenzoic acid were associated with metabolites involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, and perfluoroalkyl substances were linked to bile acids-hormones that regulate cholesterol and glucose metabolism-and inflammatory signaling molecules. Some hypotheses generated from these findings were confirmed by analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel approach to discovering associations between chemical exposures and biological processes of potential relevance for disease causation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organophosphate pesticides (OP) are widely used for both agricultural and domestic purposes. Epidemiological studies suggest neurotoxicity in children after exposure to organophosphates pesticides (OP) at low levels but possible mechanism is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed at investigating the effects of prenatal exposure to OPs on inhibitory control of 10-12 year-old-children assessed by a motor inhibition task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Ninety-five children from the PELAGIE cohort (Brittany-France, from 2002) underwent a fMRI examination during which inhibition was assessed by a Go/No-Go task. Task performance was assessed by average response latency, commission rate and composite performance score (PS). Whole brain activation was estimated by modeling the hemodynamic response related to inhibition demand and successful inhibition. OP exposure was assessed by measuring six dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites in the urine of women in early pregnancy ({$<$}19 WG). Concentrations were summed to obtain overall levels of diethylphosphate (DE), dimethylphosphate (DM) and total non-specific metabolites (DAP), standardized to homogenize sampling conditions and categorized into levels of exposure: low (reference), moderate or high. Regression models were adjusted for potential cofounders considered by restriction and statistical criteria. RESULTS: Moderate levels of DAP were associated with a decreased commission rate (β~=~-6.65\%, p~=~0.04), indicating improved performance. Increasing levels of DM and DE were associated with decreased brain activity in the left inferior and bilateral superior frontal regions during successful inhibition. We did not observe any differential activation related to inhibitory demands. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that prenatal OPs may be associated with altered pattern of brain activity in regions related to inhibition among children and need to be confirmed by additional studies.},

The purposes of this paper are: (i) to overview the recent emergence of prediction underpinning steps in contemporary causal inference methods as a useful perspective on contemporary causal inference methods, and (ii) explore the role of machine learning (as one approach to ‘best prediction’) in causal inference. Causal inference methods covered include propensity scores, inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs), G computation and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Machine learning has been used more for propensity scores and TMLE, and there is potential for increased use in G computation and estimation of IPTWs.},

Alternatives, such as Oldham's method and the variance ratio test, have been advocated, although these are limited in the presence of measurement errors with non-constant variance. Furthermore, such methods prohibit the consideration of additional covariates (e.g., treatment group within trials) or confounders (e.g., age and gender). This study illustrates the more sophisticated approach of multilevel modelling (MLM) which overcomes these limitations and provides a comprehensive solution to the analysis of change with respect to baseline values. Although mathematical coupling is widespread throughout applied research, one particular area where several studies have suggested a strong relationship between baseline disease severity and treatment effect is guided tissue regeneration (GTR) within dental research. For illustration, we use GTR studies where the original data were found to be available in the literature for reanalysis. We contrast the results from an MLM approach and Oldham's method with the standard (incorrect) approach that suffers from mathematical coupling. MLM provides a robust solution when relating change to baseline and is capable of simultaneously dealing with complex error structures and additional covariates and/or potential confounders.},

However, few data are available to assess the maternal risks of gestational exposure by race and infant sex.

We enrolled pregnant African American (n\,=\,152) and white (n\,=\,158) women with singleton live births between 18 and 22\,weeks gestation. We measured phthalate metabolites (mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monomethyl phthalate (MMP), and the sums of DEHP (ΣDEHP) and DBP (ΣDBP) metabolites) in up to two gestational urine specimens from mothers, and evaluated confounder-adjusted associations per natural log unit greater concentration with birth weight for gestational age z-score, small for gestational age (SGA; {$<$}10th \%tile), preterm birth (PTB; {$<$}37\,weeks gestation), and low birth weight (LBW; {$<$}2500\,g). We also tested for interactions by maternal race and infant sex. We found that lower z-scores were associated with greater MiBP (β\,=\,−0.28; 95\% CI: −0.54, −0.02) and MMP (β\,=\,−0.30; 95\% CI: −0.52, −0.09) concentrations, while MEP interacted with race (p\,=\,0.04), indicating an association among whites (β\,=\,−0.14; 95\% CI: −0.28, 0.001) but not among African Americans (β\,=\,0.05; 95\% CI\,=\,−0.09, 0.19). Greater MiBP (OR\,=\,2.82; 95\% CI: 1.21, 6.56) and MEOHP (OR\,=\,2.80; 95\% CI: 1.05, 7.42) were associated with an overall higher SGA risk, greater MEHP was associated with higher SGA risk (p\,=\,0.10) in whites (OR\,=\,3.26 95\% CI: 0.64, 16.56) but not in African Americans (OR\,=\,0.71 95\% CI: 0.07, 7.17), and the associations for MiBP (p\,=\,0.02) and ΣDBP (p\,=\,0.02) varied by infant sex. We detected interactions for PTB in which African Americans were at higher risk than whites for greater MiBP (p\,=\,0.08) and MEP (p\,=\,0.02) although lower risk for greater MEHP (p\,=\,0.09). Greater MEP was associated with an overall higher LBW risk (OR\,=\,1.33; 95\% CI: 0.95, 1.86), and males were at higher risk than females with greater MBP (p\,=\,0.002), MiBP (p\,=\,0.02), MBzP (p\,=\,0.01), MEP (p\,=\,0.002), MMP (p\,=\,0.09), and ΣDBP (p\,=\,0.01) concentrations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures is of increasing interest in environmental epidemiology. Recently, a new approach for estimating the health effects of mixtures, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), has been developed. This method estimates the multivariable exposure-response function in a flexible and parsimonious way, conducts variable selection on the (potentially high-dimensional) vector of exposures, and allows for a grouped variable selection approach that can accommodate highly correlated exposures. However, the application of this novel method has been limited by a lack of available software, the need to derive interpretable output in a computationally efficient manner, and the inability to apply the method to non-continuous outcome variables. METHODS: This paper addresses these limitations by (i) introducing an open-source software package in the R programming language, the bkmr R package, (ii) demonstrating methods for visualizing high-dimensional exposure-response functions, and for estimating scientifically relevant summaries, (iii) illustrating a probit regression implementation of BKMR for binary outcomes, and (iv) describing a fast version of BKMR that utilizes a Gaussian predictive process approach. All of the methods are illustrated using fully reproducible examples with the provided R code. RESULTS: Applying the methods to a continuous outcome example illustrated the ability of the BKMR implementation to estimate the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures in the context of a highly nonlinear, biologically-based dose-response function, and to estimate overall, single-exposure, and interactive health effects. The Gaussian predictive process method led to a substantial reduction in the runtime, without a major decrease in accuracy. In the setting of a larger number of exposures and a dichotomous outcome, the probit BKMR implementation was able to correctly identify the variables included in the exposure-response function and yielded interpretable quantities on the scale of a latent continuous outcome or on the scale of the outcome probability. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed software, integrated suite of tools, and extended methodology makes BKMR accessible for use across a broad range of epidemiological applications in which multiple risk factors have complex effects on health.},

  abstract = {Because humans are invariably exposed to complex chemical mixtures, estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant exposures is of critical concern in environmental epidemiology, and to regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.},

  abstract = {Background: In utero exposure of the fetus to a stressor can lead to disease in later life. Epigenetic mechanisms are likely mediators of later-life expression of early-life events., Objectives: We examined the current state of understanding of later-life diseases resulting from early-life exposures in order to identify in utero and postnatal indicators of later-life diseases, develop an agenda for future research, and consider the risk assessment implications of this emerging knowledge., Methods: This review was developed based on our participation in a National Research Council workshop titled “Use of in Utero and Postnatal Indicators to Predict Health Outcomes Later in Life: State of the Science and Research Recommendations.” We used a case study approach to highlight the later-life consequences of early-life malnutrition and arsenic exposure., Discussion: The environmental sensitivity of the epigenome is viewed as an adaptive mechanism by which the developing organism adjusts its metabolic and homeostatic systems to suit the anticipated extrauterine environment. Inappropriate adaptation may produce a mismatch resulting in subsequent increased susceptibility to disease. A nutritional mismatch between the prenatal and postnatal environments, or early-life obesogen exposure, may explain at least some of the recent rapid increases in the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Early-life arsenic exposure is also associated with later-life diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer., Conclusions: With mounting evidence connecting early-life exposures and later-life disease, new strategies are needed to incorporate this emerging knowledge into health protective practices.},

  abstract = {Encouraged by decision makers’ appetite for future information on topics ranging from elections to pandemics, and enabled by the explosion of data and computational methods, model-based forecasts have garnered increasing influence on a breadth of decisions in modern society. Using several classic examples from fisheries management, I demonstrate that selecting the model or models that produce the most accurate and precise forecast (measured by statistical scores) can sometimes lead to worse outcomes (measured by real-world objectives). This can create a forecast trap, in which the outcomes such as fish biomass or economic yield decline while the manager becomes increasingly convinced that these actions are consistent with the best models and data available. The forecast trap is not unique to this example, but a fundamental consequence of non-uniqueness of models. Existing practices promoting a broader set of models are the best way to avoid the trap.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous treatment effects are driven by treatment effect modifiers, pre-treatment covariates that modify the effect of a treatment on an outcome. Current approaches for uncovering these variables are limited to low-dimensional data, data with weakly correlated covariates, or data generated according to parametric processes. We resolve these issues by developing a framework for defining model-agnostic treatment effect modifier variable importance parameters applicable to high-dimensional data with arbitrary correlation structure, deriving one-step, estimating equation and targeted maximum likelihood estimators of these parameters, and establishing these estimators' asymptotic properties. This framework is showcased by defining variable importance parameters for data-generating processes with continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes with binary treatments, and deriving accompanying multiply-robust and asymptotically linear estimators. Simulation experiments demonstrate that these estimators' asymptotic guarantees are approximately achieved in realistic sample sizes for observational and randomized studies alike. This framework is applied to gene expression data collected for a clinical trial assessing the effect of a monoclonal antibody therapy on disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. Genes predicted to have the greatest potential for treatment effect modification have previously been linked to breast cancer. An open-source R package implementing this methodology, unihtee, is made available on GitHub at https://github.com/insightsengineering/unihtee.},

  abstract = {An endeavor central to precision medicine is predictive biomarker discovery; they define patient subpopulations which stand to benefit most, or least, from a given treatment. The identification of these biomarkers is often the byproduct of the related but fundamentally different task of treatment rule estimation. Using treatment rule estimation methods to identify predictive biomarkers in clinical trials where the number of covariates exceeds the number of participants often results in high false discovery rates. The higher than expected number of false positives translates to wasted resources when conducting follow-up experiments for drug target identification and diagnostic assay development. Patient outcomes are in turn negatively affected. We propose a variable importance parameter for directly assessing the importance of potentially predictive biomarkers, and develop a flexible semiparametric inference procedure for this estimand. We prove that our estimator is double-robust and asymptotically linear under loose conditions on the data-generating process, permitting valid inference about the importance metric. The statistical guarantees of the method are verified in a thorough simulation study representative of randomized control trials with moderate and high-dimensional covariate vectors. Our procedure is then used to discover predictive biomarkers from among the tumor gene expression data of metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients enrolled in recently completed clinical trials. We find that our approach more readily discerns predictive from non-predictive biomarkers than procedures whose primary purpose is treatment rule estimation. An open-source software implementation of the methodology, the uniCATE R package, is briefly introduced.},

  abstract = {Epigenetics investigates heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. Several epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, can change genome function under exogenous influence. We review current evidence indicating that epigenetic alterations mediate effects caused by exposure to environmental toxicants. Results obtained from animal models indicate that in utero or early-life environmental exposures produce effects that can be inherited transgenerationally and are accompanied by epigenetic alterations. The search for human equivalents of the epigenetic mechanisms identified in animal models is under way. Recent investigations have identified a number of environmental toxicants that cause altered methylation of human repetitive elements or genes. Some exposures can alter epigenetic states and the same and/or similar epigenetic alterations can be found in patients with the disease of concern. On the basis of current evidence, we propose possible models for the interplay between environmental exposures and the human epigenome. Several investigations have examined the relationship between exposure to environmental chemicals and epigenetics, and have identified toxicants that modify epigenetic states. Whether environmental exposures have transgenerational epigenetic effects in humans remains to be elucidated. In spite of the current limitations, available evidence supports the concept that epigenetics holds substantial potential for furthering our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of environmental toxicants, as well as for predicting health-related risks due to conditions of environmental exposure and individual susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Humans are exposed daily to a variety of environmental contaminants. For many of these, the associated health effects remain largely unexplored. There is growing evidence that untargeted metabolomics-based techniques could be used to identify simultaneously biomarkers of effect (i.e. disruption of endogenous metabolite profiles) and exposure (i.e. xenobiotic mixtures) in biological samples. This approach is expending quickly and has been used in several studies over the last 5 years to study biological effects of many environmental contaminants in humans. Hence, this review attempts to determine whether metabolomics might constitute a relevant tool to discover new early biomarkers of effects related to chemical exposure in humans. Published results suggest that common metabolic pathways are affected by specific groups of chemicals such as PAHs, metals, organochlorine compounds, pesticides, and endocrine disrupting plasticizers. Remarkably, disruption of cellular signaling pathways associated with oxidative stress may be primary drivers for further effects for all studied chemicals. In the future, the introduction of more sensitive analytical techniques to perform untargeted profiling of biological samples seems to be a good option to improve the coverage of the xeno-metabolome and to provide more relevant information on both chemical exposure and metabolic signatures of environmental contaminants. Some current challenges are finally discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective: Interest in candidate gene and candidate gene-by-environment interaction hypotheses regarding major depressive disorder remains strong despite controversy surrounding the validity of previous findings. In response to this controversy, the present investigation empirically identified 18 candidate genes for depression that have been studied 10 or more times and examined evidence for their relevance to depression phenotypes. Methods: Utilizing data from large population-based and case-control samples (Ns ranging from 62,138 to 443,264 across subsamples), the authors conducted a series of preregistered analyses examining candidate gene polymorphism main effects, polymorphism-by-environment interactions, and gene-level effects across a number of operational definitions of depression (e.g., lifetime diagnosis, current severity, episode recurrence) and environmental moderators (e.g., sexual or physical abuse during childhood, socioeconomic adversity). Results: No clear evidence was found for any candidate gene polymorphism associations with depression phenotypes or any polymorphism-by-environment moderator effects. As a set, depression candidate genes were no more associated with depression phenotypes than noncandidate genes. The authors demonstrate that phenotypic measurement error is unlikely to account for these null findings. Conclusions: The study results do not support previous depression candidate gene findings, in which large genetic effects are frequently reported in samples orders of magnitude smaller than those examined here. Instead, the results suggest that early hypotheses about depression candidate genes were incorrect and that the large number of associations reported in the depression candidate gene literature are likely to be false positives.},

  abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

  abstract = {Two-sample summary-data Mendelian randomization (MR) incorporating multiple genetic variants within a meta-analysis framework is a popular technique for assessing causality in epidemiology. If all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable (IV) and necessary modelling assumptions, then their individual ratio estimates of causal effect should be homogeneous. Observed heterogeneity signals that one or more of these assumptions could have been violated.Causal estimation and heterogeneity assessment in MR require an approximation for the variance, or equivalently the inverse-variance weight, of each ratio estimate. We show that the most popular ‘first-order’ weights can lead to an inflation in the chances of detecting heterogeneity when in fact it is not present. Conversely, ostensibly more accurate ‘second-order’ weights can dramatically increase the chances of failing to detect heterogeneity when it is truly present. We derive modified weights to mitigate both of these adverse effects.Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the modified weights outperform first- and second-order weights in terms of heterogeneity quantification. Modified weights are also shown to remove the phenomenon of regression dilution bias in MR estimates obtained from weak instruments, unlike those obtained using first- and second-order weights. However, with small numbers of weak instruments, this comes at the cost of a reduction in estimate precision and power to detect a causal effect compared with first-order weighting. Moreover, first-order weights always furnish unbiased estimates and preserve the type I error rate under the causal null. We illustrate the utility of the new method using data from a recent two-sample summary-data MR analysis to assess the causal role of systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease risk.We propose the use of modified weights within two-sample summary-data MR studies for accurately quantifying heterogeneity and detecting outliers in the presence of weak instruments. Modified weights also have an important role to play in terms of causal estimation (in tandem with first-order weights) but further research is required to understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific settings.},

The fetus, infant and child might have enhanced sensitivity to environmental stressors such as EDCs due to their rapid development and increased exposure to some EDCs as a consequence of development-specific behaviour, anatomy and physiology. In this Review, I discuss epidemiological studies examining the relationship between early-life exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, triclosan and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with childhood neurobehavioural disorders and obesity. The available epidemiological evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to several of these ubiquitous EDCs is associated with adverse neurobehaviour (BPA and phthalates) and excess adiposity or increased risk of obesity and/or overweight (PFAS). Quantifying the effects of EDC mixtures, improving EDC exposure assessment, reducing bias from confounding, identifying periods of heightened vulnerability and elucidating the presence and nature of sexually dimorphic EDC effects would enable stronger inferences to be made from epidemiological studies than currently possible. Ultimately, improved estimates of the causal effects of EDC exposures on child health could help identify susceptible subpopulations and lead to public health interventions to reduce these exposures.},

  abstract = {Background: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders, but identifying relevant chemicals within mixtures of EDCs is difficult. Objective: Our goal was to identify gestational EDC exposures associated with autistic behaviors. Methods: We measured the concentrations of 8 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, 25 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 organochlorine pesticides, 8 brominated flame retardants, and 4 perfluoroalkyl substances in blood or urine samples from 175 pregnant women in the HOME (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) Study (Cincinnati, OH). When children were 4 and 5 years old, mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a measure of autistic behaviors. We examined confounder-adjusted associations between 52 EDCs and SRS scores using a two-stage hierarchical analysis to account for repeated measures and confounding by correlated EDCs. Results: Most of the EDCs were associated with negligible absolute differences in SRS scores (≤ 1.5). Each 2-SD increase in serum concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether-28 (PBDE-28) (β = 2.5; 95\% CI: –0.6, 5.6) or trans-nonachlor (β = 4.1; 95\% CI: 0.8–7.3) was associated with more autistic behaviors. In contrast, fewer autistic behaviors were observed among children born to women with detectable versus nondetectable concentrations of PCB-178 (β = –3.0; 95\% CI: –6.3, 0.2), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β = –3.3; 95\% CI: –6.1, –0.5), or PBDE-85 (β = –3.2; 95\% CI: –5.9, –0.5). Increasing perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations were also associated with fewer autistic behaviors (β = –2.0; 95\% CI: –4.4, 0.4). Conclusions: Some EDCs were associated with autistic behaviors in this cohort, but our modest sample size precludes us from dismissing chemicals with null associations. PFOA, β-hexachlorocyclohexane, PCB-178, PBDE-28, PBDE-85, and trans-nonachlor deserve additional scrutiny as factors that may be associated with childhood autistic behaviors.

  abstract = {The field of environmental epidemiology has been using “-omics” technologies, including the exposome, metabolome, and methylome, to understand the potential effects and biological pathways of a number of environmental pollutants. However, the majority of studies have focused on a single disease or phenotype, and have not systematically considered patterns of multimorbidity and whether environmental pollutants have pleiotropic effects. These questions could be addressed by examining the relation between environmental exposures and the phenome – the patterns and profiles of human health that individuals experience from birth to death. By conducting Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), we can generate new hypotheses about new or poorly understood exposures, identify novel associations for established toxicants, and better understand biological pathways affected by environmental pollutants. In this article, we provide a conceptual framework for conducting PheWAS in environmental epidemiology and summarize some of the advantages and challenges to using the PheWAS to study environmental pollutant exposures. Ultimately, by adding the PheWAS to our “-omics” toolbox, we could substantially improve our understanding of the potential health effects of environmental pollutants.},

  abstract = {Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) address exposures to multiple chemical and nonchemical stressors and often focus on characterization of health risks in vulnerable populations. Evaluating complex exposure-response relationships in CRAs requires the use of formal and rigorous methods for causal inference. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are graphical causal models used to organize and communicate knowledge about the underlying causal structure that generates observable data. Using existing graphical theories for causal inference with DAGs, risk analysts can identify confounders and effect measure modifiers to determine if the available data are both internally valid to obtain unbiased risk estimates and are generalizable to populations of interest. Conditional independencies implied by the structure of a DAG can be used to test assumptions used in a CRA against empirical data in a selected study and can contribute to the evidence evaluations related to specific causal pathways. This can facilitate quantitative use of these data, as well as help identify key research gaps, prioritize data collection activities, and evaluate risk management alternatives. DAGs also enable risk analysts to be explicit about sources of uncertainty and to determine whether a causal effect can be estimated from available data. Using a conceptual model and DAG for a hypothetical community located near a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO), we illustrate the advantages of using DAGs for evaluating causality in CRAs. DAGs also can be used in conjunction with weight of evidence (WOE) methodology to improve causal analysis for CRA, which could lead to more effective interventions to reduce population health risks.},

In birth cohort studies conducted by our group and others, in utero exposure to infectious agents, prospectively obtained after biomarker assays of archived maternal sera and by obstetric records was related to an increased risk of schizophrenia. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that prenatal exposure to influenza, increased toxoplasma antibody, genital–reproductive infections, rubella, and other pathogens are associated with schizophrenia. Anomalies of the immune system, including enhanced maternal cytokine levels, are also related to schizophrenia. Some evidence also suggests that maternal infection and immune dysfunction may be associated with autism. Although replication is required, these findings suggest that public health interventions targeting infectious exposures have the potential for preventing cases of schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, this work has stimulated translational research on the neurobiological and genetic determinants of these conditions. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol, 2012},

We review recent advances in methods for assessing susceptible periods. RECENT FINDINGS:We identified three general classes of modeling approaches aimed at identifying susceptible periods in children's environmental health research: multiple informant models, distributed lag models, and Bayesian approaches. Benefits over traditional regression modeling include the ability to formally test period effect differences, to incorporate highly time-resolved exposure data, or to address correlation among exposure periods or exposure mixtures. Several statistical approaches exist for investigating periods of susceptibility. Assessment of susceptible periods would be advanced by additional basic biological research, further development of statistical methods to assess susceptibility to complex exposure mixtures, validation studies evaluating model assumptions, replication studies in different populations, and consideration of susceptible periods from before conception to disease onset.},

  abstract = {Early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may alter adipogenesis and energy balance leading to changes in obesity risk. Several studies have evaluated the association of prenatal bisphenol A exposure with childhood body size but only one study of male infants has examined other environmental phenols. Therefore, we assessed associations between prenatal exposure to environmental phenols and fat mass in a prospective birth cohort. We quantified four phenol biomarkers in third trimester maternal spot urine samples in a cohort of women enrolled in New York City between 1998 and 2002 and evaluated fat mass in their children using a Tanita scale between ages 4 and 9years (173 children with 351 total observations). We estimated associations of standard deviation differences in natural log creatinine-standardized phenol biomarker concentrations with percent fat mass using linear mixed effects regression models. We did not observe associations of bisphenol A or triclosan with childhood percent fat mass. In unadjusted models, maternal urinary concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol were associated with greater percent fat mass and benzophenone-3 was associated with lower percent fat mass among children. After adjustment, phenol biomarkers were not associated with percent fat mass. However, the association between benzophenone-3 and percent fat mass was modified by child's sex: benzophenone-3 concentrations were inversely associated with percent fat mass in girls (beta=−1.51, 95\% CI=−3.06, 0.01) but not boys (beta=−0.20, 95\% CI=−1.69, 1.26). Although we did not observe strong evidence that prenatal environmental phenols exposures influence the development of childhood adiposity, the potential antiadipogenic effect of benzophenone-3 in girls may warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {Non-targeted metabolomics constitutes a part of the systems biology and aims at determining numerous metabolites in complex biological samples. Datasets obtained in the non-targeted metabolomics studies are high-dimensional due to sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based detection methods as well as complexity of biological matrices. Therefore, a proper selection of variables which contribute into group classification is a crucial step, especially in metabolomics studies which are focused on searching for disease biomarker candidates. In the present study, three different statistical approaches were tested using two metabolomics datasets (RH and PH study). The orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) without and with multiple testing correction as well as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with bootstrapping, were tested and compared. For the RH study, OPLS-DA model built without multiple testing correction selected 46 and 218 variables based on the VIP criteria using Pareto and UV scaling, respectively. For the PH study, 217 and 320 variables were selected based on the VIP criteria using Pareto and UV scaling, respectively. In the RH study, OPLS-DA model built after correcting for multiple testing, selected 4 and 19 variables as in terms of Pareto and UV scaling, respectively. For the PH study, 14 and 18 variables were selected based on the VIP criteria in terms of Pareto and UV scaling, respectively. In the RH and PH study, the LASSO selected 14 and 4 variables with reproducibility between 99.3 and 100\%, respectively. In the light of PLS-based models, the larger the search space the higher the probability of developing models that fit the training data well with simultaneous poor predictive performance on the validation set. The LASSO offers potential improvements over standard linear regression due to the presence of the constrain, which promotes sparse solutions. This paper is the first one to date utilizing the LASSO penalized logistic regression in untargeted metabolomics studies.},

Indeed, it is rare for an issue of any leading journal of social or personality psychology not to include such an analysis. Statisticians have for decades criticized this method on the grounds that it relies on implausible assumptions, but these criticisms have been largely ignored. After presenting examples and simulations that dramatize the weaknesses of the measurement-of-mediation approach, we suggest that scholars instead use an approach that is rooted in experimental design. We propose implicit-mediation analysis, which adds and subtracts features of the treatment in ways that implicate some mediators and not others. We illustrate the approach with examples from recently published articles, explain the differences between the approach and other experimental approaches to mediation, and formalize the assumptions and statistical procedures that allow researchers to learn from experiments that encourage changes in mediators.},

This is a step in the right direction because mediation analyses based on nonexperimental data are likely to be biased and because experiments, in principle, provide a sound basis for causal inference. But even experiments cannot overcome certain threats to inference that arise chiefly or exclusively in the context of mediation analysis-threats that have received little attention in psychology. The authors describe 3 of these threats and suggest ways to improve the exposition and design of mediation tests. Their conclusion is that inference about mediators is far more difficult than previous research suggests and is best tackled by an experimental research program that is specifically designed to address the challenges of mediation analysis.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies, which typically report regression coefficients summarizing the associations of many genetic variants with various traits, are potentially a powerful source of data for Mendelian randomization investigations. We demonstrate how such coefficients from multiple variants can be combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and efficiency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of gene-gene interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and 'weak instruments' on these estimates. Both an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least squares method for individual-level data, even when there are gene-gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each variant is less than 1×10⁻⁵, then weak instrument bias will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on coronary artery disease using published data on five genetic variants. A 30\% reduction in LDL-C is estimated to reduce coronary artery disease risk by 67\% (95\% CI: 54\% to 76\%). We conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly efficient to those using individual-level data, although the necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental chemicals may play a role in the development of obesity. Evidence suggests phthalate exposure may be associated with obesity in children and adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of ten urinary phthalate metabolites mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-(carboxylnonyl) phthalate (MCNP), and mono-(carboxyoctyl) phthalate (MCOP) grouped by molecular weight of their parent compounds with body weight outcomes in children, adolescent and adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010. METHODS: We performed multinomial logistic regression to analyze the association between obesity and urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in children and adolescents and adults. RESULTS: Low molecular weight (LMW) phthalate metabolites (MnBP, MEP and MiBP) are significantly (p{$<$}0.05) associated with higher odds for obesity in male children and adolescents. High molecular weight (HMW) phthalate metabolites (MECPP, MEHHP, MEOHP, MEHP, MBzP, MCNP, and MCOP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites (MEHHP, MEOHP, MEHP and MECPP) are significantly (p{$<$}0.05) associated with higher OR for obesity in all adults. Additionally, DEHP metabolites are significantly associated with obesity in all female adults; whereas DEHP and HMW metabolites are significantly associated with OR for obesity in males 60 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: We found age and sex differences in the association between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and body weight outcomes. Reverse causation cannot be excluded since overweight and obese people will have more fat mass, they may store more phthalates, thus leading to higher excretion concentrations.},

  abstract = {Although body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used anthropometric measure, newer indices such as the waist-to-height ratio, better reflect the location and amount of ectopic fat, as well as the weight of the skeleton, and may be more useful.The prognostic value of several newer anthropometric indices was compared with that of BMI in patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) enrolled in prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to determine impact on global mortality and morbidity in heart failure. The primary outcome was HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death. The association between anthropometric indices and outcomes were comprehensively adjusted for other prognostic variables, including natriuretic peptides. An ‘obesity-survival paradox’ related to lower mortality risk in those with BMI ≥25\hspace{0.25em}kg/m2 (compared with normal weight) was identified but this was eliminated by adjustment for other prognostic variables. This paradox was less evident for waist-to-height ratio (as an exemplar of indices not incorporating weight) and eliminated by adjustment: the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for all-cause mortality, for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1, was 1.10 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.87–1.39]. However, both BMI and waist-to-height ratio showed that greater adiposity was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome and HF hospitalization; this was more evident for waist-to-height ratio and persisted after adjustment e.g. the aHR for HF hospitalization for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 of waist-to-height ratio was 1.39 (95\% CI 1.06–1.81).In patients with HFrEF, alternative anthropometric measurements showed no evidence for an ‘obesity-survival paradox’. Newer indices that do not incorporate weight showed that greater adiposity was clearly associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exposome is defined as encompassing all environmental exposures one undergoes from conception onwards. Challenges of the application of this concept to environmental-health association studies include a possibly high false-positive rate. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to reduce the dimension of the exposome using information from DNA methylation as a way to more efficiently characterize the relation between exposome and child body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Among 1,173 mother-child pairs from HELIX cohort, 216 exposures ("whole exposome") were characterized. BMI and DNA methylation from immune cells of peripheral blood were assessed in children at age 6-10 years. A priori reduction of the methylome to preselect BMI-relevant CpGs was performed using biological pathways. We then implemented a tailored Meet-in-the-Middle approach to identify from these CpGs candidate mediators in the exposome-BMI association, using univariate linear regression models corrected for multiple testing: this allowed to point out exposures most likely to be associated with BMI ("reduced exposome"). Associations of this reduced exposome with BMI were finally tested. The approach was compared to an agnostic exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) ignoring the methylome. RESULTS: Among the 2284 preselected CpGs (0.6\% of the assessed CpGs), 62 were associated with BMI. Four factors (3 postnatal and 1 prenatal) of the exposome were associated with at least one of these CpGs, among which postnatal blood level of copper and PFOS were directly associated with BMI, with respectively positive and negative estimated effects. The agnostic ExWAS identified 18 additional postnatal exposures, including many persistent pollutants, generally unexpectedly associated with decreased BMI. DISCUSSION: Our approach incorporating a priori information identified fewer significant associations than an agnostic approach. We hypothesize that this smaller number corresponds to a higher specificity (and possibly lower sensitivity), compared to the agnostic approach. Indeed, the latter cannot distinguish causal relations from reverse causation, e.g. for persistent compounds stored in fat, whose circulating level is influenced by BMI.},

  abstract = {Objective: The association between phthalates and endometriosis risk is inconclusive. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the association between five different phthalate metabolites and endometriosis, based on current evidence. Methods: The literature included PubMed, WOS (web of science), and EMBASE, published until 3 March 2019. We selected the related literature and evaluated the relationship between phthalates exposure and endometriosis risk. All statistical analyses were conducted with STATA version 12.0. Results: Data from eight studies were used in this review. The results of this analysis showed that mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) exposure was potentially associated with endometriosis (OR = 1.246, 95\% CI = 1.003-1.549). We have not found positive results in mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) analyses (MEHP: OR = 1.089, 95\% CI = 0.858-1.383; MEP: OR = 1.073, 95\% CI = 0.899-1.282; MBzP: OR = 0.976, 95\% CI = 0.810-1.176; MEOHP: OR = 1.282, 95\% CI = 0.874-1.881). In subgroup analyses for regions, the associations were significant between MEHHP and endometriosis in Asia (OR = 1.786, 95\% CI = 1.005-3.172, I² = 0\%), but not in USA (OR = 1.170, 95\% CI = 0.949-1.442, I² = 45.6\%). Conclusions: Our findings suggested a potential statistical association between MEHHP exposure and endometriosis, particularly, the exposure of MEHHP might be a potential risk for women with endometriosis in Asia. However, positive associations between the other four Phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and endometriosis was not found. Given the weak strength of the results, well-designed cohort studies, with large sample sizes, should be performed in future.},

  abstract = {Convergent evidence associates exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with major human diseases, even at regulation-compliant concentrations. This might be because humans are exposed to EDC mixtures, whereas chemical regulation is based on a risk assessment of individual compounds. Here, we developed a mixture-centered risk assessment strategy that integrates epidemiological and experimental evidence. We identified that exposure to an EDC mixture in early pregnancy is associated with language delay in offspring. At human-relevant concentrations, this mixture disrupted hormone-regulated and disease-relevant regulatory networks in human brain organoids and in the model organisms               Xenopus leavis               and               Danio rerio               , as well as behavioral responses. Reinterrogating epidemiological data, we found that up to 54\% of the children had prenatal exposures above experimentally derived levels of concern, reaching, for the upper decile compared with the lowest decile of exposure, a 3.3 times higher risk of language delay.                        ,              Mixed chemicals’ potential risks                            Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment can cause a variety of potential health problems in human patients. Such exposures are not isolated, however, and environmental safety regulations that only consider doses of individual chemicals do not take multisubstance exposures into account. Caporale               et al               . examined chemical exposure data in a large cohort of human mother-child pairs and identified a set of common endocrine-disrupting chemicals (see the Perspective by Liew and Guo). The authors then showed that a mixture of these substances could cause abnormalities in two model organisms and may also be associated with language delay in humans. These findings suggest a need for further research into the effects of chemical mixtures and regulations that take such combinatorial effects into account. —YN                        ,              Exposure to mixed endocrine-disrupting chemicals is common in pregnant women and may be associated with language delay in their children.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are compounds that interfere with physiological hormonal regulation. Humans are pervasively exposed to many different EDCs, and a growing body of evidence indicates that early life exposure to such EDC mixtures can induce changes in the human organism that underlie increased susceptibility to diseases throughout the life span, including neurodevelopmental disorders. Chemical regulation is, however, entirely based on the risk assessment of individual compounds, leaving the real-life impact of chemical mixtures unexamined and unregulated. This is relevant insofar as cumulative exposure to multiple compounds may be associated with adverse health outcomes even when the concentrations of individual chemicals fall below the regulatory dose.                                         RATIONALE               We set out to make the epidemiological associations between exposure to mixtures and health outcomes experimentally tractable, defining molecular pathways and dose responses that could be translated back to actual human exposures and thereby refine current risk assessment practices. As opposed to previous studies that focused on single compounds, we identified and tested an EDC mixture associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy (SELMA) pregnancy cohort (MIX N) by integrating epidemiological data with experimental toxicology and characterized real life–relevant exposure.                                         RESULTS                                We used weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to identify chemicals associated with language delay in children and included those chemicals in MIX N. MIX N was synthesized following the relative proportions and total concentrations found in the SELMA cohort. It was then tested in both in vitro and in vivo models. In human fetal primary neural stem cells and three-dimensional cortical brain organoids differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells, transcriptomic analysis showed that MIX N interferes with hormonal pathways and dysregulates expression of genes and biological pathways that are causally linked to autism spectrum disorders. Data from experiments in                 Xenopus leavis                 and                 Danio rerio                 , in vivo models validated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), confirmed thyroid function as one of the key and unifying points of vulnerability to MIX N and linked thyroid disruption to neurodevelopmental effects measured as alterations in locomotor activity. The resulting dose-response relationships were then used to estimate a point of departure (POD), which is the toxicological measure to estimate no-effect concentration. This enabled us to apply a similar mixture approach (SMACH) where we (i) identified individuals in the SELMA study who were sufficiently similarly exposed compared with the experimental mixtures and (ii) determined the proportion of the SELMA children with exposure ranges of concern using the POD as reference.                                                        CONCLUSION               Integrating experimental and epidemiological evidence, we established mechanistic and correlative evidence for neurodevelopmental adversities of an EDC mixture associated with language delay. Using the generated experimental data in a risk assessment concept, we found increased odds of language delay in offspring of up to 54\% of pregnant women. These results emphasize the need to take mixtures into account during chemical testing and risk assessment and provide an integrative framework to guide risk assessment strategies.                                                   Diagram showing the integrative framework of the study.                   A mixture of EDCs was associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the SELMA pregnancy cohort and was tested in human in vitro and in in vivo models to elucidate the molecular and functional impact of exposure. Experimental data were finally referred back to the cohort for risk assessment by a similar mixture approach. PFAS, perfluoroalkyl substance.},

  abstract = {In risk evaluation, the effect of mixtures of environmental chemicals on a common adverse outcome is of interest. However, due to the high dimensionality and inherent correlations among chemicals that occur together, the traditional methods (e.g. ordinary or logistic regression) suffer from collinearity and variance inflation, and shrinkage methods have limitations in selecting among correlated components. We propose a weighted quantile sum (WQS) approach to estimating a body burden index, which identifies "bad actors" in a set of highly correlated environmental chemicals. We evaluate and characterize the accuracy of WQS regression in variable selection through extensive simulation studies through sensitivity and specificity (i.e., ability of the WQS method to select the bad actors correctly and not incorrect ones). We demonstrate the improvement in accuracy this method provides over traditional ordinary regression and shrinkage methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net). Results from simulations demonstrate that WQS regression is accurate under some environmentally relevant conditions, but its accuracy decreases for a fixed correlation pattern as the association with a response variable diminishes. Nonzero weights (i.e., weights exceeding a selection threshold parameter) may be used to identify bad actors; however, components within a cluster of highly correlated active components tend to have lower weights, with the sum of their weights representative of the set.},

Traditional, non-instrumental variable methods for mediation analysis experience a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding between an exposure, mediator and outcome and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step MR. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, interactions between exposures and mediators and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although MR relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our simulations demonstrate that these methods are unaffected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR. MR mediation methods require different assumptions to be made, compared with non-instrumental variable mediation methods. Where these assumptions are more plausible, MR can be used to improve causal inference in mediation analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposome studies are challenged by exposure misclassification for non-persistent chemicals, whose temporal variability contributes to bias in dose-response functions. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the variability of urinary concentrations of 24 non-persistent chemicals: 10 phthalate metabolites, 7 phenols, 6 organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites, and cotinine, between weeks from different pregnancy trimesters in pregnant women, and between days and between seasons in children. METHODS: 154 pregnant women and 152 children from six European countries were enrolled in 2014-2015. Pregnant women provided three urine samples over a day (morning, midday, and night), for one week in the 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters. Children provided two urines a day (morning and night), over two one-week periods, six months apart. We pooled all samples for a given subject that were collected within a week. In children, we also made four daily pools (combining morning and night voids) during the last four days of the first follow-up week. Pools were analyzed for all 24 metabolites of interest. We calculated intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and estimated the number of pools needed to obtain an ICC above 0.80. RESULTS: All phthalate metabolites and phenols were detected in {$>$}90\% of pools whereas certain OP pesticide metabolites and cotinine were detected in {$<$}43\% of pools. We observed fair (ICC = 0.40-0.59) to good (0.60-0.74) between-day reliability of the pools of two samples in children for all chemicals. Reliability was poor ({$<$}0.40) to fair between trimesters in pregnant women and between seasons in children. For most chemicals, three daily pools of two urines each (for weekly exposure windows) and four weekly pools of 15-20 urines each would be necessary to obtain an ICC above 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: This quantification of the variability of biomarker measurements of many non-persistent chemicals during several time windows shows that for many of these compounds a few dozen samples are required to accurately assess exposure over periods encompassing several trimesters or months.},

METHODS: We measured BPA and eight phthalates [four di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (DEHPm), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three low-molecular-weight phthalate metabolites (LMWPm)] in two spot-urine samples collected during the first and third trimester of pregnancy. We estimated growth curves for femur length (FL), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) during pregnancy (weeks 12-20 and 20-34), and for birth weight, birth length, head circumference at birth, and placental weight. RESULTS: Overall, results did not support associations of exposure to BPA or DEHPm during pregnancy with fetal growth parameters. Prenatal MBzP exposure was positively associated with FL at 20-34 weeks, resulting in an increase of 3.70\% of the average FL (95\% CI: 0.75, 6.63\%) per doubling of MBzP concentration. MBzP was positively associated with birth weight among boys (48 g; 95\% CI: 6, 90) but not in girls (-27 g; 95\% CI: -79, 25) (interaction p-value = 0.04). The LMWPm mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was negatively associated with HC at 12-20 pregnancy weeks [-4.88\% of HC average (95\% CI: -8.36, -1.36\%)]. CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the first to combine repeat exposure biomarker measurements and multiple growth measures during pregnancy, finds little evidence of associations of BPA or phthalate exposures with fetal growth. Phthalate metabolites MBzP and MnBP were associated with some fetal growth parameters, but these findings require replication.

  abstract = {Background: Humans are exposed to complex mixtures of phthalate chemicals from a range of consumer products. Previous studies have reported significant associations between individual phthalate metabolites and pregnancy outcomes, but mixtures research is limited. Objectives: We used the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats longitudinal pregnancy cohort to investigate associations between phthalate metabolite mixtures and pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Women ( n=462 n=462  carrying females,  n=540 n=540  carrying males) provided up to three urine samples throughout gestation (median 18, 22, and 26 wk), which were analyzed for 13 phthalate metabolites. Pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth (PTB), spontaneous PTB, small and large for gestational age (SGA, LGA), birth weight z-score, and gestational age at delivery were abstracted from medical records. Environmental risk scores (ERS) were calculated as a weighted linear combination of the phthalates from ridge regression and adaptive elastic net, which are variable selection methods to handle correlated predictors. Birth outcomes were regressed on continuous ERS. We assessed gestational average and visit-specific ERS and stratified all analyses by fetal sex. Finally, we used Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to explore nonlinear associations and interactions between metabolites. Results: Differences in metabolite weights from ridge and elastic net were apparent between birth outcomes and between fetal sexes. An interquartile range increase in gestational average phthalate ERS was associated with increased odds of PTB [male  odds\,ratio\,(OR)=1.56 odds\,ratio\,(OR)=1.56 ; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 2.27; female  OR=1.91 OR=1.91 ; 95\% CI: 1.23, 2.98], spontaneous PTB (male  OR=2.32 OR=2.32 ; 95\% CI: 1.46, 3.68; female  OR=2.00 OR=2.00 ; 95\% CI: 1.04, 3.82), and reduced gestational age at birth (male  β=−0.39 β=−0.39  wk, 95\% CI:  −0.62 −0.62 ,  −0.15 −0.15 ; female  β=−0.29 β=−0.29  wk, 95\% CI: −0.52 −0.52 ,  −0.05 −0.05 ). Analyses by study visit suggested that exposure at  ∼22 ∼22  wk (range 20–24 wk) was driving those associations. Bivariate plots from BKMR analysis revealed some nonlinear associations and metabolite interactions that were different between fetal sexes. Discussion: These results suggest that exposure to phthalate mixtures was associated with increased risk of early delivery and highlight the need to study mixtures by fetal sex. We also identified various metabolites displaying nonlinear relationships with measures of birth weight. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8990},

  abstract = {Introduction Brain development is highly dependent on hormonal regulation. Exposure to chemicals disrupting endocrine signaling has been associated with neurodevelopmental impairment. This raises concern about exposure to the suspected thousands of endocrine disruptors, and has resulted in efforts to improve regulation of these chemicals. Yet, the causal links between endocrine disruption and developmental neurotoxicity, which would be required for regulatory action, are still largely missing.Areas covered In this review, we illustrate the importance of two endocrine systems, thyroid hormone and retinoic acid pathways, for neurodevelopment. We place special emphasis on TH and RA synthesis, metabolism, and how endocrine disrupting chemicals known or suspected to affect these systems are associated with developmental neurotoxicity.Expert opinion While it is clear that neurodevelopment is dependent on proper hormonal functioning, and evidence is increasing for developmental neurotoxicity induced by endocrine disrupting chemicals, this is not grasped by current chemical testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop test methods detecting endocrine disruption in the context of neurodevelopment. Key to this development is further mechanistic insights on the involvement of endocrine signaling in neurodevelopment as well as increased support to develop and validate new test methods for the regulatory context.},

  abstract = {Organophosphate based pesticides are widely used in the agricultural sector, and exposure to these chemicals is common for the general population. Pesticides are toxic due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterases, and the potential for adverse health effects have been investigated in past and recent studies. Human biomonitoring of organophosphate pesticide exposure is carried out through the determination of the metabolites in urine (dialkylphosphates, DAPs). Hereby we present a new method for determination of the 6 non-specific metabolites dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), dimethyl dithiophosphate (DMDTP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP) in urine based on off-line solid phase extraction (anion exchange, 96-well plates) followed by ion-pair ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Recoveries and accuracies in control urine spiked at 5ng/mL ranged from 48\% to109\% and from 91\% to 115\%, respectively. The method limits of detection for the DAPs were 1.2ng/mL for DMP, 0.38ng/mL for DEP, 0.20ng/mL for DMTP, 0.33ng/mL for DETP, 0.64ng/mL for DMDTP, and 0.15ng/mL for DEDTP. The method was applied to samples from a Norwegian mother/child study group (n=48/56) and the DAPs detection frequencies in urine from mothers and children were about: 40\% for DMP, 95\% for DEP, 96\% for DMTP, 50\% for DETP, 15\% for DMDTP, and 1\% for DEDTP. In both mothers and children, the most abundant DAPs were DMTP (median 2.4/5.2ng/mL) and DEP (median 2.6/3.4ng/mL) followed by DMP (median 1.5/2.1ng/mL). The SG corrected concentrations of DEP and DETP in mothers were statistically higher than in children (p-value{$<$}0.05; Mann-Whitney test) which might suggest a higher exposure to pesticides in these mothers, or significant differences in toxicokinetics between adults and children. The method was proven robust and suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies.},

Associations between g and specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several candidate genes involved in brain function have been reported. We sought to replicate published associations between g and 12 specific genetic variants (in the genes DTNBP1, CTSD, DRD2, ANKK1, CHRM2, SSADH, COMT, BDNF, CHRNA4, DISC1, APOE, and SNAP25) using data sets from three independent, well-characterized longitudinal studies with samples of 5,571, 1,759, and 2,441 individuals. Of 32 independent tests across all three data sets, only 1 was nominally significant. By contrast, power analyses showed that we should have expected 10 to 15 significant associations, given reasonable assumptions for genotype effect sizes. For positive controls, we confirmed accepted genetic associations for Alzheimer?s disease and body mass index, and we used SNP-based calculations of genetic relatedness to replicate previous estimates that about half of the variance in g is accounted for by common genetic variation among individuals. We conclude that the molecular genetics of psychology and social science requires approaches that go beyond the examination of candidate genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to reduced fetal growth. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. METHODS: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8-14~weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. RESULTS: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR~=~1.32, 95\% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR~=~1.20, 95\% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Do phthalates create a male reproductive hormone imbalance by down-regulating the secretion of testosterone and insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Our study suggests that exposure to phthalates is related to a reduction in the secretion of testosterone and INSL3 in adult males. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is evidence that exposure to phthalates, an abundant group of industrial plasticizers, negatively affects testosterone biosynthesis, but little is known about the mechanism in men. The hypothesis that exposure to phthalates reduces the levels of testosterone and INSL3, a marker of Leydig cell function, is underexplored. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This case-control study of 176 men ran from 2010 to 2012. Infertile men were recruited through infertility clinics in Taiwan, fertile men were recruited from childbirth preparation classes and all were categorized based on the World Health Organization definition of infertility and by the diagnoses of obstetricians. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Urinary concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites were measured, along with serum levels of FSH, LH, total testosterone (TT), estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin and Inhibin B. Androgen status indices including free testosterone (fT) and the free androgen index (FAI) were calculated. The circulating INSL3 level was evaluated using a radioimmunoassay. Non-parametric analyses, trend tests and linear regression models were used. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Urinary mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate were significantly higher in infertile than in fertile men. Serum Inhibin B, the Inhibin B : FSH ratio, the TT : LH ratio and INSL3 were significantly lower in infertile men. In multiple regression models controlled for potential confounders, there is an inverse association between urinary levels of mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), MEHP, MEHP\% and serum TT (P = 0.001, 0.007, 0.042 and 0.012, respectively). The inverse associations were also found between urinary levels of MiBP, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), MEHP, MEHP\% and serum fT (P = 0.028, 0.017, 0.045 and 0.027, respectively); between urinary levels of MMP, MEHP, MEHP\% and the TT : LH ratio (P = 0.004, 0.029 and 0.039, respectively); between urinary levels of MMP, MiBP, MnBP, MBzP, MEHP and the FAI (P = 0.002, 0.008, 0.037, 0.028, 0.042 and 0.016, respectively). Urinary MBzP and MEHP\% were negatively associated with a decrease in serum INSL3 (P = 0.049 and {$<$}0.001). We also observed a strong inverse relationship between MEHP\% quartiles and serum TT, fT, the TT : LH ratio and INSL3 (Ptrend = 0.003, 0.080, 0.002 and 0.012, respectively). Serum INSL3, TT, fT and the TT : LH ratio were lower for men in the highest MEHP\% quartile than in the reference group (P = 0.007, 0.002, 0.090 and 0.001, respectively). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A potential limitation is using a single urine and blood sample to predict urinary phthalate metabolites and reproductive hormone status over long periods. However, there is evidence that a single measure provides a reliable result in population studies. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Non-occupational exposure to phthalates, including di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, might lead to adverse effects on testicular/Leydig cell function and be of concern owing to the ubiquitous multisource exposure to phthalates among the general population. Although our findings are in agreement with recent experimental data, more studies are required to draw firm conclusions on the relation of INSL3 to phthalate exposure or testicular/Leydig cell function.},

  abstract = {Background It is of critical importance to evaluate the role of environmental chemical exposures in premature birth. While a number of studies investigate this relationship, most utilize single exposure measurements during pregnancy in association with the outcome. The studies with repeated measures of exposure during pregnancy employ primarily cross-sectional analyses that may not be fully leveraging the power and additional information that the data provide. Methods We examine 9 statistical methods that may be utilized to estimate the relationship between a longitudinal exposure and a binary, non-time-varying outcome. To exemplify these methods we utilized data from a nested case–control study examining repeated measures of urinary phthalate metabolites during pregnancy in association with preterm birth. Results The methods summarized may be useful for: 1) Examining sensitive windows of exposure in association with an outcome; 2) Summarizing repeated measures to estimate the relationship between average exposure and an outcome; 3) Identifying acute exposures that may be relevant to the outcome; and 4) Understanding the contribution of temporal patterns in exposure levels to the outcome of interest. In the study of phthalates, changes in urinary metabolites over pregnancy did not appear to contribute significantly to preterm birth, making summary of average exposure across gestation optimal given the current design. Conclusions The methods exemplified may be of great use in future epidemiologic research projects intended to: 1) Elucidate the complex relationships between environmental chemical exposures and preterm birth; 2) Investigate biological mechanisms in prematurity using repeated measures of maternal factors throughout pregnancy; and 3) More generally, address the relationship between a longitudinal predictor and a binary, non-time-varying outcome.

  abstract = {Background: Maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy can influence various maternal and offspring health parameters. Modification of maternal metabolism by environmental exposure may be an important pathway for these impacts. However, there is limited evidence regarding exposure to a wide array of chemicals and the metabolome during pregnancy. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between the urinary exposome and metabolome during pregnancy. Methods: Urine samples were collected in the first and third trimesters from 1,024 pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in Jiangsu Province, China. The exposome was analyzed using the first trimester sample with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The metabolome was analyzed using the third trimester sample with UHPLC-HRMS. We evaluated associations between each of 106 exposures in the first trimester with 139 metabolites in the third trimester. Results: We identified 1,245 significant associations ( p{$<$}3.39× 10 −6 p{$<$}3.39×10−6 , Bonferroni correction) between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Among elements, the largest number of the significant metabolic associations were observed for magnesium, and among organic compounds, for 4- tert tert -octylphenol. We used exposome–metabolome associations to explore mechanisms underlying published associations between prenatal chemical exposures and offspring health outcomes. This integration of the literature with our results suggests that reported associations between 10 analytes and birth weight, gestational age, fat deposition, neurobehavioral development, immunological disorders, and hypertension may be partially mediated by metabolites associated with these exposures. Discussion: This high-dimensional analysis of the urinary exposome and metabolome identified many associations between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Integration of these associations with the literature on health outcomes of exposure suggests that environmental modulation of the maternal metabolome may play a role in the association between prenatal exposure on pregnancy and child health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9745},

  abstract = {Preterm birth is defined by the onset of labor at a gestational age shorter than 37 weeks, and it can lead to premature birth and impose a threat to newborns’ health. The Puerto Rico PROTECT cohort is a well-characterized prospective birth cohort that was designed to investigate environmental and social contributors to preterm birth in Puerto Rico, where preterm birth rates have been elevated in recent decades. To elucidate possible relationships between metabolites and preterm birth in this cohort, we conducted a nested case-control study to conduct untargeted metabolomic characterization of maternal plasma of 31 women who experienced preterm birth and 69 controls who underwent full-term labor at 24–28 gestational weeks.A total of 333 metabolites were identified and annotated with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Subsequent weighted gene correlation network analysis shows that the fatty acid and carene-enriched module has a significant positive association (P = 8e−04, FDR = 0.006) with preterm birth. After controlling for potential clinical confounders, a total of 38 metabolites demonstrated significant changes uniquely associated with preterm birth, where 17 of them were preterm biomarkers. Among 7 machine-learning classifiers, the application of random forest achieved a highly accurate and specific prediction (AUC = 0.92) for preterm birth in testing data, demonstrating their strong potential as biomarkers for preterm births. The 17 preterm biomarkers are involved in cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and lipid peroxidation functions. Additional modeling using only the 19 spontaneous preterm births (sPTB) and controls identifies 16 sPTB markers, with an AUC of 0.89 in testing data. Half of the sPTB overlap with those markers for preterm births. Further causality analysis infers that suberic acid upregulates several fatty acids to promote preterm birth.Altogether, this study demonstrates the involvement of lipids, particularly fatty acids, in the pathogenesis of preterm birth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is great interest in understanding whether interventions on sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption through pregnancy and early childhood affect adolescent body mass index (BMI). Without data from randomised trials, unbiased estimation of such effects might be achieved with observational data given sufficient and appropriate adjustment for both baseline and time-varying confounders. OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the use of inverse probability (IP) weighting of marginal structural models (MSM) for estimating the effects of SSB consumption through pregnancy and early childhood on the mean early adolescent BMI z-score. METHODS: Our baseline sample consisted of 1584 pregnant women from a pre-birth cohort. We defined 6 intervention intervals: early pregnancy, late pregnancy, 3, 4, 5, and 6~years. We fitted a MSM via a weighted linear regression with IP exposure and censoring weights to estimate the mean difference in BMI z-score under interventions: "maintain SSB consumption below (vs above) 0.5 servings/day in all intervals." RESULTS: The estimated difference in mean BMI z-score under interventions maintaining SSB consumption at or below (vs above) 0.5 servings/day from pregnancy to 6~years was -0.94 (95\% confidence interval [CI] -1.52, -0.08). The effect estimate in pregnancy, while fixing the exposure range in childhood, was -0.05 (95\% CI -0.34, 0.23), and in early childhood, while fixing the range in pregnancy was -0.89 (95\% CI -1.46, -0.11). The effect estimates were largely unchanged under sensitivity analyses to different implementation choices except for the choice of time interval length. CONCLUSIONS: Under assumptions that include no unmeasured confounding and selection bias, and no model misspecification, results of this~IP weighting application are in line with a lower mean BMI z-score in early adolescence under interventions ensuring lower, vs greater, SSB consumption in early life. This application provides a resource for researchers working with longitudinal birth cohort studies and interested in similar causal questions.},

Objective We investigated the relationship between the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and children’s intellectual functioning. Methods This study enrolled 667 children at nine elementary schools in five South Korean cities. A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on neuropsychological tests were obtained from both the children and their mothers. Results We measured mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate (MEOHP), both metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), in urine samples. The geometric mean (ln) concentrations of MEHP, MEOHP, and MBP were 21.3 μg/L [geometric SD (GSD) = 2.2 μg/L; range, 0.5–445.4], 18.0 μg/L (GSD = 2.4; range, 0.07–291.1), and 48.9 μg/L (GSD = 2.2; range, 2.1–1645.5), respectively. After adjusting for demographic and developmental covariates, the Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ scores were negatively associated with DEHP metabolites but not with DBP metabolites. We also found a significant negative relationship between the urine concentrations of the metabolites of DEHP and DBP and children’s vocabulary subscores. After controlling for maternal IQ, a significant inverse relationship between DEHP metabolites and vocabulary subscale score remained. Among boys, we found a negative association between increasing MEHP phthalate concentrations and the sum of DEHP metabolite concentrations and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children vocabulary score; however, among girls, we found no significant association between these variables. Conclusion Controlling for maternal IQ and other covariates, the results show an inverse relationship between phthalate metabolites and IQ scores; however, given the limitations in cross-sectional epidemiology, prospective studies are needed to fully explore these associations.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic studies often quantify exposure using biomarkers, which commonly have statistically skewed distributions. Although normality assumption is not required if the biomarker is used as an independent variable in linear regression, it has become common practice to log-transform the biomarker concentrations. This transformation can be motivated by concerns for nonlinear dose-response relationship or outliers; however, such transformation may not always reduce bias. In this study, we evaluated the validity of motivations underlying the decision to log-transform an independent variable using simulations, considering eight scenarios that can give rise to skewed X and normal Y. Our simulation study demonstrates that (1) if the skewness of exposure did not arise from a biasing factor (e.g., measurement error), the analytic approach with the best overall model fit best reflected the underlying outcome generating methods and was least biased, regardless of the skewness of X and (2) all estimates were biased if the skewness of exposure was a consequence of a biasing factor. We additionally illustrate a process to determine whether the transformation of an independent variable is needed using NHANES. Our study and suggestion to divorce the shape of the exposure distribution from the decision to log-transform it may aid researchers in planning for analysis using biomarkers or other skewed independent variables.},

  abstract = {Background Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are a class of flame retardants in common use. OPEs can easily leach from materials, resulting in human exposure. Increasing concentrations have been reported in human populations over the past decade. Recent studies have linked prenatal OPE exposure to hyperactivity and attention problems in children. Such behaviors are often found among children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), however, no study has investigated OPEs in relation to clinically assessed ADHD. Objective To evaluate prenatal exposure to OPEs as risk factors for clinically assessed ADHD using a case-cohort study nested within the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Methods We included in the case group 295 ADHD cases obtained via linkage with the Norwegian Patient Registry, and the sub-cohort group 555 children sampled at baseline, irrespective of their ADHD case status. Prenatal concentrations of OPE metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected at 17~weeks of gestation, and included diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP), bis(2-butoxyethyl) hydrogen phosphate (BBOEP), and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP). We estimated risk ratios and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals [95\% CI] using logistic regression, adjusting for season of urine collection, child sex, birth year, and maternal depression, education, and sum of urinary di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) concentration during pregnancy. To assess the overall impact of simultaneously decreasing exposure to all chemical constituents of an OPE-phthalate mixture, quantile based g-computation was implemented. The mixture constituents included OPE and phthalate metabolites commonly detected in our study. In all models, we considered effect measure modification by child sex and polymorphisms in genes encoding paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. Mediation analysis was conducted using thyroid function biomarkers estimated from maternal blood collected at 17~weeks of gestation. Results DPHP was detected in nearly all samples (97.2\%), with a higher geometric mean among the case group (0.70~µg/L) as compared to the sub-cohort (0.52~µg/L). DNBP was commonly detected as well (93.8\%), while BBOEP (52.9\%) and BDCIPP (22.9\%) were detected less frequently. A higher risk of ADHD was observed in children with greater than median exposure to DPHP during pregnancy (risk ratio: 1.38 [95\% CI: 0.96, 1.99]), which was slightly higher among girls (2.04 [1.03, 4.02]) and children of mothers with PON1 Q192R genotype QR (1.69 [0.89, 3.19]) or PON1 Q192R genotype RR (4.59 [1.38, 15.29]). The relationship between DPHP and ADHD (total risk ratio: 1.34 [0.90, 2.02]) was partially mediated through total triiodothyronine to total thyroxine ratio (natural direct effect: 1.29 [0.87, 1.94]; natural indirect effect: 1.04 [1.00, 1.10]; 12.48\% mediated). We also observed an elevated risk of ADHD in relation to BDCIPP detection during pregnancy (1.50 [0.98, 2.28]). We did not observe notable differences in ADHD by DNBP (0.88 [0.62, 1.26]) or BBOEP (1.03 [0.73, 1.46]) during pregnancy. Simultaneously decreasing all constituents of common-detect OPE-phthalate mixture, specifically DPHP, DNBP, and 6 phthalate metabolites, by a quartile resulted in an ADHD risk ratio of 0.68 [0.64, 0.72]. Conclusion Prenatal exposure to DPHP and BDCIPP may increase the risk of ADHD. For DPHP, we observed potential modification by child sex and maternal PON1 Q192R genotype and partial mediation through maternal thyroid hormone imbalance at 17~weeks gestation.},

To investigate associations between leptin and heart function and subclinical cardiovascular disease adjusted for total body fat, and to investigate the causal relation between leptin and cardiovascular disease using Mendelian randomisation. Methods and results Leptin concentrations, total body fat and diverse measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease were determined in participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study. Linear regression between leptin concentration and measures of heart function, ECG measures, and carotid intima media thickness as a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis was adjusted for potential confounding factors, and additionally including total body fat. We analysed the combined effects of genetic variants from a GWAS on leptin concentrations in publicly-available summary statistics of coronary heart disease GWAS (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, n=184,305). 6,107 men and women, mean (SD) age 56 (6) years, BMI 26 (4) kg/m2, and median leptin concentration 12.1 μg (IQR: 6.7-22.6). In observational analyses, leptin was weakly associated with heart function and subclinical cardiovascular disease, but these associations attenuated when adjusting for total body fat. A doubling of genetically-determined leptin concentration was associated with an odds ratio of cardiovascular disease of 0.69 (0.37, 1.27). Conclusion Observational associations between leptin and subclinical measures of cardiovascular disease were largely explained by differences in total body fat. Results of analyses of genetically-determined leptin and coronary heart disease risk were inconclusive due to a large confidence interval.},

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as ‘extreme scenarios’. Finally, we describe problems with a common ‘benchmarking’ practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},

  abstract = {In this article, we argued that the term stress has served as a valuable heuristic, helping researchers to integrate traditions that illuminate different stages of the process linking stressful life events to disease. We provided a short history of three traditions in the study of stress: the epidemiological, psychological, and biological. The epidemiological tradition focuses on defining which circumstances and experiences are deemed stressful on the basis of consensual agreement that they constitute threats to social or physical well-being. The psychological tradition focuses on individuals? perceptions of the stress presented by life events on the basis of their appraisals of the threats posed and the availability of effective coping resources. The biological tradition focuses on brain-based perturbations of physiological systems that are otherwise essential for normal homeostatic regulation and metabolic control. The foci of these three traditions have informed elements of a stage model of disease, wherein events appraised as stressful are viewed as triggering affective states that in turn engender behavioral and biological responses having possible downstream implications for disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birthweight is an indicator of fetal growth and environmental-related alterations of birthweight have been linked with multiple disorders and conditions progressing into adulthood. Although a few studies have assessed the association between birthweight and the totality of exogenous exposures and their downstream molecular responses in maternal urine and cord blood; no prior research has considered a) the maternal serum prenatal metabolome, which is enriched for hormones, and b) non-linear and synergistic associations among exposures. METHODS: We measured the maternal serum metabolome during pregnancy using an untargeted metabolomics approach and birthweight for gestational age (BWGA) z-score in 410 mother-child dyads enrolled in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort. We leveraged a Bayesian factor analysis for interaction to select the most important metabolites associated with BWGA z-score and to evaluate their linear, non-linear and non-additive associations. We also assessed the primary biological functions of the identified proteins using the MetaboAnalyst, a centralized repository of curated functional information. We compared our findings with those of a traditional metabolite-wide association study (MWAS) in which metabolites are individually associated with BWGA z-score. RESULTS: Among 1110 metabolites, 46 showed evidence of U-shape associations with BWGA z-score. Most of the identified metabolites (85\%) were lipids primarily enriched for pathways central to energy production, immune function, and androgen and estrogen metabolism, which are essential for pregnancy and parturition processes. Metabolites within the same class, i.e. steroids and phospholipids, showed synergistic relationships with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that the aspects of the maternal metabolome during pregnancy contribute linearly, non-linearly and synergistically to variation in newborn birthweight.},

Aim:~         To determine the association between in-utero exposure to eight OCs and childhood BMI measures (BMI and BMI z-score) at 4 years and their yearly change across 4–12 years of age in 279 Rhea child-mother dyads.         Methods:~         We applied three approaches: (1) linear mixed-effect regressions (LMR) to associate individual compounds with BMI measures; (2) Bayesian weighted quantile sum regressions (BWQSR) to provide an overall OC mixture association with BMI measures; and (3)Bayesian varying coefficient kernel machine regressions (BVCKMR) to model nonlinear and nonadditive associations.         Results:~         In the LMR, yearly change of BMI measures was consistently associated with a quartile increase in hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (estimate [95\% Confidence or Credible interval] BMI: 0.10 [0.06, 0.14]; BMI z-score: 0.02 [0.01, 0.04]). BWQSR results showed that a quartile increase in mixture concentrations was associated with yearly increase of BMI measures (BMI: 0.10 [0.01, 0.18]; BMI z-score: 0.03 [0.003, 0.06]). In the BVCKMR, a quartile increase in dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene concentrations was associated with higher BMI measures at 4 years (BMI: 0.33 [0.24, 0.43]; BMI z-score: 0.19 [0.15, 0.24]); whereas a quartile increase in HCB and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)-118 levels was positively associated with BMI measures yearly change (BMI: HCB:0.10 [0.07, 0.13], PCB-118:0.08 [0.04, 012]; BMI z-score: HCB:0.03 [0.02, 0.05], PCB-118:0.02 [0.002,04]). BVCKMR suggested that PCBs had nonlinear relationships with BMI measures, and HCB interacted with other compounds.         Conclusions:~         All analyses consistently demonstrated detrimental associations between prenatal OC exposures and childhood BMI measures.},

  abstract = {Objective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has several known genetic determinants, yet the mechanisms through which they lead to disease onset remain poorly understood. This study aims to estimate the effects of genetic liability to AD on plasma metabolites measured at seven different stages across the life course. Methods Genetic and metabolomic data from 5,648 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort were used. Linear regression models examined the association between higher AD liability, as measured by a genetic risk score (GRS), and plasma metabolites measured at 8, 16, 18 and 25 years of age. Two hundred twenty-nine metabolites were studied, most relating to lipid/lipoprotein traits. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed using summary statistics from age-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same metabolites for 118,466 participants from the UK Biobank, to examine the persistence of any AD liability effects into late adulthood. Results The GRS including the APOE4 isoform demonstrated the strongest positive associations for cholesterol-related traits per doubling of genetic liability to AD, e.g., for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at age 25yrs (0.12 SD; 95\% CI 0.09, 0.14), with similar magnitudes of association across age groups in ALSPAC. In the UK Biobank, the effect of AD liability decreased with age tertile for several lipid traits (e.g., LDL-C, youngest: 0.15 SD; 95\% CI 0.07, 0.23, intermediate: 0.13 SD; 95\% CI 0.07, 0.20, oldest: 0.10 SD; 95\% CI 0.05, 0.16). Across both cohorts, the effect of AD liability on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) attenuated as age increased. Fatty acid metabolites also demonstrated positive associations in both cohorts, though smaller in magnitude compared with lipid traits. Sensitivity analyses indicated that these effects were driven by the APOE4 isoform. Conclusions These results support a profound influence of the APOE4 isoform on circulating lipids and fatty acids from early life to later adulthood. Such lipid and fatty acid traits may be implicated in early AD pathogenesis and warrant further investigation as potential targets for preventing the onset of AD.},

  abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization—the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception—provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization—the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology—the theme of this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology—is seen by many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of the limitations of observational epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to return value for the common good, must be integrated into public health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE Net—http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established to promote the use of genetic knowledge—in terms of genetic tests and services—for disease prevention and health promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6 likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is interpreted and developed through experience and context—and is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a more robust understanding of environmental determinants of disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7–10 This approach has recently been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’.11–15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian randomization.Box 1 ‘Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment’‘A consortium of leading European research centres and pharmaceutical companies will this week announce a plan to transform epidemiology by combining it with the new techniques of high-throughput biology. They plan to create a new field of study—genomic epidemiology—by using screening technologies derived from the human genome project … We think it is important to expand classical epidemiology and genetic epidemiology to take it to this high-throughput mode, says Esper Boel, vice-president of biotechnology research at Novo Nordisk.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that utilizes genetic variants that are robustly associated with such modifiable exposures to generate more reliable evidence regarding which interventions should produce health benefits. The approach is being widely applied, and various ways to strengthen inference given the known potential limitations of MR are now available. Developments of MR, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, network MR, two-step MR, factorial MR and multiphenotype MR, are outlined in this review.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolic differences have been reported between individuals with and without Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but their consistency and causal relevance has been unclear. METHODS: We conducted a metabolome-wide association study of MDD with 249 metabolomic measures available in UK Biobank (N = 29, 757). We then applied 2-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomisation (MR) and colocalization analysis to identify potentially causal relationships between each metabolite and MDD. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one metabolites tested were significantly associated with MDD (PFDR {$<$} 0.05), which reduced to 129 after adjustment for likely confounders. Lower abundance of Omega-3 fatty acid measures and a higher Omega-6: Omega-3 ratio showed potentially causal effects on liability to MDD. There was no evidence of a causal effect of MDD on metabolite levels. Furthermore, genetic signals associated with Docosahexaenoic Acid colocalized with loci associated with MDD within the FADS gene cluster. Post-hoc MR of gene-transcript abundance within the FADS cluster demonstrated a causal association with MDD. In contrast, colocalization analysis did not suggest a single causal variant for both transcript abundance and MDD liability, but the likely existence of two variants in LD with one another. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that decreased Docosahexaenoic Acid and increased Omega-6: Omega-3 fatty acids ratio may be causally related to MDD. These findings provide further support for the causal involvement of fatty acids in MDD.},

  abstract = {Background: Optimization of mixture analyses is critical to assess potential impacts of human exposures to multiple pollutants. Single-index regression methods quantify total mixture association and chemical component contributions. Single-index methods include several variants of quantile g-computation (QGC) and weighted quantile sum regression (WQSr), though each has limitations. Objectives: We developed a novel permutation test for WQSr and compared its performance to extant versions of WQSr and QGC in simulation studies and an analysis of prenatal phthalates and childhood cognition. Methods: WQSr uses ensemble nonlinear optimization to identify weights for mixture exposures in an index associated with the outcome in a prespecified direction, with ensembles based on bootstrap resampling (WQSBS) or random subsetting of exposures (WQSRS). Statistical significance can be assessed without splitting the data (Nosplit), by splitting the data into training and test sets (Split), by repeatedly holding out test sets (RH), or by using a novel permutation test (PT) to obtain a more accurate  p p -value. QGC instead provides a sum mixture coefficient and component coefficients with no constraints on direction. In simulations, we compared false positive rates (FPR) and power to detect true associations and accuracy in estimating mixture weights. We also estimated associations between prenatal phthalate mixtures and childhood IQ in the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood cohort using each method. Results: FPR was well controlled at  ≤7\% ≤7\%  in all but the Nosplit WQSr variants. Among these methods, the WQSBS and WQSRS PT variants had the highest power (89\%–98\%), with lower power for QGC (85\%–93\%) and RH (60\%–97\%) or Split WQSr variants (40\%–78\%). WQSr methods estimated mixture weights 2–4 times more accurately than the QGC method. Coefficients for mixture associations with full scale IQ varied 3- to 4-fold across analytic methods. Discussion: WQSr paired with our novel permutation test best balanced power and false positive rate when assessing a mixture effect. As new methods develop, each should be examined for performance and applicability. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10570},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher urate levels are associated with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adults, and in pregnancy with lower offspring birthweight. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses suggest a causal effect of higher urate on higher SBP and of higher maternal SBP on lower offspring birthweight. If urate causally reduces birthweight, it might confound the effect of SBP on birthweight. We therefore tested for a causal effect of maternal urate on offspring birthweight. METHODS: We tested the association between maternal urate levels and offspring birthweight using multivariable linear regression in the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH; n\,=\,872) and UK Biobank (UKB; n\,=\,133{$\mkern1mu$}187). We conducted two-sample MR to test for a causal effect of maternal urate [114 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); n\,=\,288{$\mkern1mu$}649 European ancestry] on offspring birthweight (n\,=\,406{$\mkern1mu$}063 European ancestry; maternal SNP effect estimates adjusted for fetal effects). We assessed a causal relationship between urate and SBP using one-sample MR in UKB women (n\,=\,199{$\mkern1mu$}768). RESULTS: Higher maternal urate was associated with lower offspring birthweight with similar confounder-adjusted magnitudes in EFSOCH [22\,g lower birthweight per 1-SD higher urate (95\%~CI: -50, 6); P\,=\,0.13] and UKB [-28\,g (95\% CI: -31, -25); P\,=\,1.8\,×\,10-75]. The MR causal effect estimate was directionally consistent, but smaller [-11\,g (95\%~CI: -25, 3); PIVW\,=\,0.11]. In women, higher urate was causally associated with higher SBP [1.7\,mmHg higher SBP per 1-SD higher urate (95\%~CI: 1.4, 2.1); P\,=\,7.8\,×\,10-22], consistent with that previously published in women and men. CONCLUSION: The marked attenuation of the MR result of maternal urate on offspring birthweight compared with the multivariable regression result suggests previous observational associations may be confounded. The 95\% CIs of the MR result included the null but suggest a possible small effect on birthweight. Maternal urate levels are unlikely to be an important contributor to offspring birthweight.},

  abstract = {Birth weight is the single most important risk indicator for neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity, which has led to the idiom that ‘every ounce counts’. Birth weight in turn, however, tends to vary widely across populations as a result of differential fetal growth velocity with such demographic factors as ethnicity, maternal and paternal height and altitude of residence. Accordingly, it has been acknowledged that the appraisal of birth weight should rely on its position relative to the birth weight distribution of the background population. This is commonly done by standardizing birth weight through its deviation from the population mean in the given gestational age stratum, as can be obtained from population-customized birth weight nomograms. This issue was recently revisited in ‘Human Reproduction’ through a plea for reporting birth weight as z-scores. In this article, we argue that adjustment for factors, such as gestational age, which may lie on the causal pathway from exposures present at the time of conception [e.g. single-embryo transfer (SET) versus double-embryo transfer (DET)] to birth weight, may induce bias, regardless of whether the adjustment happens via stratification, regression or through the use of z-scores.},

Leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR can be used to estimate the causal effects of one phenotype on another even when experimental research is not feasible, and therefore has the potential to be highly informative. It is dependent on strong assumptions however, often producing biased results if these are not met. It is therefore imperative that these assumptions are well-understood by researchers aiming to use MR, in order to evaluate their validity in the context of their analyses and data. The aim of this perspective is therefore to further elucidate these assumptions and the role they play in MR, as well as how different kinds of data can be used to further support them.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A Healthy Lifestyle Score (HLS) (5-point scale including diet, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol con‑sumption and BMI) was estimated in 1016 Hortega Study participants, who had targeted plasma metabolomic deter‑minations at baseline examination in 2001–2003, and were followed-up to 2015 to ascertain incident type 2 diabetes.

In the subset of 830 participants without prevalent type 2 diabetes, the rate ratio (RR) and rate difference (RD) of inci‑dent type 2 diabetes (n cases\,=\,51) per one-point increase in HLS was, respectively, 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.51, 0.93), and\,−\,8.23 (95\% CI, −\,16.34, −\,0.13)/10,000 person-years. In single-metabolite models, most of the HLS-related metabolites were prospectively associated with incident type 2 diabetes. In probit Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, these prospec‑tive associations were mostly driven by medium HDL particle concentration and phenylpropionate, followed by small LDL particle concentration, which jointly accounted for \textasciitilde\,50\% of the HLS-related decrease in incident type 2 diabetes. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The HLS showed a strong inverse association with incident type 2 diabetes, which was largely explained by plasma metabolites measured years before the clinical diagnosis.},

  abstract = {There is growing recognition that the risk of many diseases in later life, such as type 2 diabetes or breast cancer, is affected by adult as well as early-life variables, including those operating prior to conception and during the prenatal period. Most of these risk factors are correlated because of common biologic and/or social pathways, while some are intrinsically ordered over time. The study of how they jointly influence later (“distal”) disease outcomes is referred to as life course epidemiology. This area of research raises several issues relevant to the current debate on causal inference in epidemiology. The authors give a brief overview of the main analytical and practical problems and consider a range of modeling approaches, their differences determined by the degree with which associations present (or presumed) among the correlated explanatory variables are explicitly acknowledged. Standard multiple regression (i.e., conditional) models are compared with joint models where more than one outcome is specified. Issues arising from measurement error and missing data are addressed. Examples from two cohorts in the United Kingdom are used to illustrate alternative modeling strategies. The authors conclude that more than one analytical approach should be adopted to gain more insight into the underlying mechanisms.},

In moderate-to-large dimensions, the use of flexible data-adaptive regression estimators may aid in achieving this consistency. However, n1/2-consistency of doubly robust estimators is not guaranteed if one of the nuisance estimators is inconsistent. In this paper, we present a doubly robust estimator for survival analysis with the novel property that it converges to a Gaussian variable at an n1/2-rate for a large class of data-adaptive estimators of the nuisance parameters, under the only assumption that at least one of them is consistently estimated at an n1/4-rate. This result is achieved through the adaptation of recent ideas in semiparametric inference, which amount to (i) Gaussianizing (ie, making asymptotically linear) a drift term that arises in the asymptotic analysis of the doubly robust estimator and (ii) using cross-fitting to avoid entropy conditions on the nuisance estimators. We present the formula of the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which allows for the computation of doubly robust confidence intervals and p values. We illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimator in simulation studies and demonstrate its use in a phase III clinical trial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive breast cancer.},

With continuous or multi-valued treatments or exposures, such counterfactuals may be of little practical interest because no feasible intervention can be implemented that would bring them about. Longitudinal modified treatment policies (LMTPs) are a recently developed nonparametric alternative that yield effects of immediate practical relevance with an interpretation in terms of meaningful interventions such as reducing or increasing the exposure by a given amount. LMTPs also have the advantage that they can be designed to satisfy the positivity assumption required for causal inference. We present a novel sequential regression formula that identifies the LMTP causal effect, study properties of the LMTP statistical estimand such as the efficient influence function and the efficiency bound, and propose four different estimators. Two of our estimators are efficient, and one is sequentially doubly robust in the sense that it is consistent if, for each time point, either an outcome regression or a treatment mechanism is consistently estimated. We perform numerical studies of the estimators, and present the results of our motivating study on hypoxemia and mortality in intubated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As large-scale observational data become more available, caution regarding causal assumptions remains critically important. This may be especially true for Mendelian randomisation (MR), an increasingly popular approach. Point estimation in MR usually requires strong, often implausible homogeneity assumptions beyond the core instrumental conditions. Bounding, which does not require homogeneity assumptions, is infrequently applied in MR. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to demonstrate computing nonparametric bounds for the causal risk difference derived from multiple proposed instruments in an MR study where effect heterogeneity is expected. METHODS: Using data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (n~=~2056) and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n~=~6216) to study the average causal effect of maternal pregnancy alcohol use on offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, we proposed 11 maternal SNPs as instruments. We computed bounds assuming subsets of SNPs were jointly valid instruments, for all combinations of SNPs where the MR model was not falsified. RESULTS: The MR assumptions were violated for all sets with more than 4 SNPs in one cohort and for all sets with more than 2 SNPs in the other. Bounds assuming one SNP was an individually valid instrument barely improved on assumption-free bounds. Bounds tightened as more SNPs were assumed to be jointly valid instruments, and occasionally identified directions of effect, though bounds from different sets varied. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, when proposing multiple instruments, bounds can contextualise plausible magnitudes and directions of effects. Computing bounds over multiple assumption sets, particularly in large, high-dimensional data, offers a means of triangulating results across different potential sources of bias within a study and may help researchers to better evaluate and emphasise which estimates are compatible with the most plausible assumptions for their specific setting.},

Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

  abstract = {A wide range of machine-learning-based approaches have been developed in the past decade, increasing our ability to accurately model nonlinear and nonadditive response surfaces. This has improved performance for inferential tasks such as estimating average treatment effects in situations where standard parametric models may not fit the data well. These methods have also shown promise for the related task of identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. However, the estimation of both overall and heterogeneous treatment effects can be hampered when data are structured within groups if we fail to correctly model the dependence between observations. Most machine learning methods do not readily accommodate such structure. This paper introduces a new algorithm, stan4bart, that combines the flexibility of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for fitting nonlinear response surfaces with the computational and statistical efficiencies of using Stan for the parametric components of the model. We demonstrate how stan4bart can be used to estimate average, subgroup, and individual-level treatment effects with stronger performance than other flexible approaches that ignore the multilevel structure of the data as well as multilevel approaches that have strict parametric forms.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The study of lipoprotein metabolism at the population level can provide valuable information for the organisation of lipoprotein related processes in the body. To use this information towards interventional hypotheses generation and testing, we need to be able to identify the mechanistic connections among the large number of observed correlations between the measured components of the system. OBJECTIVES: To use population level metabolomics information to gain insight on their biochemical networks and metabolism. METHODS: Genetic and metabolomics information for 230 metabolic measures, predominately lipoprotein related, from a targeted nuclear magnetic resonance approach, in two samples of an established European cohort, totalling more than 9400 individuals analysed using phenotypic and genetic correlations, as well as Mendelian Randomisation. RESULTS: More than 20,500 phenotypic correlations were identified in the data, with almost 2000 also showing evidence of strong genetic correlation. Mendelian randomisation, provided evidence for a causal effect between 9496 pairs of metabolic measures, mainly between lipoprotein traits. The results provide insights on the organisation of lipoproteins in three distinct classes, the heterogeneity between HDL particles, and the association, or lack of, between CLA, glycolysis markers, such as glucose and citrate, and glycoproteins with lipids subfractions. Two examples for the use of the approach in systems biology of lipoproteins are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation can be used to infer the underlying mechanisms for the associations between lipoproteins for hypothesis generation and confirmation, and, together with biological information, to map complex biological processes.},

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

Here we present the OpenGWAS database, an open source, open access, scalable and high-performance cloud-based data infrastructure that imports and publishes complete GWAS summary datasets and metadata for the scientific community. Our import pipeline harmonises these datasets against dbSNP and the human genome reference sequence, generates summary reports and standardises the format of results and metadata. Users can access the data via a website, an application programming interface, R and Python packages, and also as downloadable files that can be rapidly queried in high performance computing environments. OpenGWAS currently contains 126 billion genetic associations from 14,582 complete GWAS datasets representing a range of different human phenotypes and disease outcomes across different populations. We developed R and Python packages to serve as conduits between these GWAS data sources and a range of available analytical tools, enabling Mendelian randomization, genetic colocalisation analysis, fine mapping, genetic correlation and locus visualisation. OpenGWAS is freely accessible at https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk, and has been designed to facilitate integration with third party analytical tools.},

However, despite this great potential, results that enter the clinical practice are scarce even twenty years after the completion of the human genome project. For this reason in this paper, we revisit problems with scientific discovery commonly summarized under the term reproducibility crisis. We will argue that the major problem that hampers progress in translational research is threefold. First, in order to establish biological foundations of disorders or general complex phenotypes, one needs to embrace emergence. Second, there seems to be confusion about the underlying hypotheses tested by omics studies. Third, most contemporary omics studies are designed to perform what can be seen as incremental corroborations of a hypothesis. In order to improve upon these shortcomings, we define a severe testing framework (STF) that can be applied to a large number of omics studies for enhancing scientific discovery in the biomedical sciences. Briefly, STF provides systematic means to trim wild-grown omics studies in a constructive way.},

  abstract = {Purpose The present study was conducted to clarify the clinicopathological impacts of DNA methylation alterations on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods Genome-wide DNA methylation screening was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and DNA methylation quantification was verified using pyrosequencing. We analyzed fresh-frozen tissues from an initial cohort (17 samples of normal control pancreatic tissue [C] from 17 patients without PDAC, and 34 samples of non-cancerous pancreatic tissue [N] and 82 samples of cancerous tissue [T] both obtained from 82 PDAC patients) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded T samples from 34 patients in a validation cohort. Results The DNA methylation profiles of N samples tended to differ from those of C samples, and 91,907 probes showed significant differences in DNA methylation levels between C and T samples. Epigenetic clustering of T samples was significantly correlated with a larger tumor diameter and early recurrence (ER), defined as relapse within 6 months after surgery. Three marker CpG sites, applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically resected materials regardless of their tumor cell content, were identified for prediction of ER. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of patients belonging to the ER group using a panel combining these three marker CpG sites, including a CpG site in the CDK14 gene, were 81.8\% and 71.7\% and 88.9\% and 70.4\% in the initial and validation cohorts, respectively. Conclusion These findings indicate that DNA methylation alterations may have a clinicopathological impact on PDAC. Application of our criteria will ultimately allow prediction of ER after surgery to improve the outcome of PDAC patients.

In 1998-2002, the Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center (New York City) investigated the effects of indoor pesticide use and exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls on pregnancy outcome and child neurodevelopment in an inner-city multiethnic cohort. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale was administered before hospital discharge (n = 311). Maternal urine samples were analyzed for six dialkylphosphate metabolites and malathion dicarboxylic acid. A random subset of maternal peripheral blood samples from the entire cohort (n = 194) was analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls and 1,1'-dichloro-2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene. Malathion dicarboxylic acid levels above the limit of detection were associated with a 2.24-fold increase in the number of abnormal reflexes (95\% confidence interval: 1.55, 3.24). Likewise, higher levels of total diethylphosphates and total dialkylphosphates were associated with an increase in abnormal reflexes, as was total dimethylphosphates after paraoxonase expression was considered. No adverse associations were found with polychlorinated biphenyl or 1,1'-dichloro-2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene levels and any behavior. The authors uncovered additional evidence that prenatal levels of organophosphate pesticide metabolites are associated with anomalies in primitive reflexes, which are a critical marker of neurologic integrity.},

At the same time, remarkable shifts in the regulations governing the composition of some consumer products that contain endocrine disruptors (EDs) has occurred. However, important questions remain as to the weight of evidence linking EDs to human health end points. In this review, we critically examine the literature linking ED exposures to child neurodevelopment, focusing in particular on two model exposures to demonstrate issues related to bioaccumulative [e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and rapidly metabolized (e.g., phthalates) compounds, respectively. Issues of study design, confounding, and exposure measurement are considered. Given widespread exposure to these compounds, the potential public health consequences of even small effects on human health are substantial.

The assessment of exposure is tightly interlinked with hazard assessment. Here, we explore if mechanistic understanding of the causal links between exposure and adverse effects on human health and the environment can be improved by integrating the exposome approach with the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept that structures and organizes the sequence of biological events from an initial molecular interaction of a chemical with a biological target to an adverse outcome. Complementing exposome research with the AOP concept may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of stress-induced adverse effects, examine the relative contributions from various components of the exposome, determine the primary risk drivers in complex mixtures, and promote an integrative assessment of chemical risks for both human and environmental health.},

Previous attempts to do this using Mendelian randomization methodologies have been hampered by the paucity of epidemiological cohorts with large numbers of genotyped mother–offspring pairs.We describe a new statistical model that we have created which can be used to estimate the effect of maternal genotypes on offspring outcomes conditional on offspring genotype, using both individual-level and summary-results data, even when the extent of sample overlap is unknown.We describe how the estimates obtained from our method can subsequently be used in large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization studies to investigate the causal effect of maternal environmental exposures on offspring outcomes. This includes studies that aim to assess the causal effect of in utero exposures related to fetal growth restriction on future risk of disease in offspring. We illustrate our framework using examples related to offspring birthweight and cardiometabolic disease, although the general principles we espouse are relevant for many other offspring phenotypes.We advocate for the establishment of large-scale international genetics consortia that are focused on the identification of maternal genetic effects and committed to the public sharing of genome-wide summary-results data from such efforts. This information will facilitate the application of powerful two-sample Mendelian randomization studies of maternal exposures and offspring outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Individuals are exposed to environmental pollutants with endocrine disrupting activity (endocrine disruptors, EDCs) and the early stages of life are particularly susceptible to these exposures. Previous studies have focused on identifying molecular signatures associated with EDCs, but none have used repeated sampling strategy and integrated multiple omics. We aimed to identify multi-omic signatures associated with childhood exposure to non-persistent EDCs. Methods We used data from the HELIX Child Panel Study, which included 156 children aged 6 to 11. Children were followed for one week, in two time periods. Twenty-two non-persistent EDCs (10 phthalate, 7 phenol, and 5 organophosphate pesticide metabolites) were measured in two weekly pools of 15 urine samples each. Multi-omic profiles (methylome, serum and urinary metabolome, proteome) were measured in blood and in a pool urine samples. We developed visit-specific Gaussian Graphical Models based on pairwise partial correlations. The visit-specific networks were then merged to identify reproducible associations. Independent biological evidence was systematically sought to confirm some of these associations and assess their potential health implications. Results 950 reproducible associations were found among which 23 were direct associations between EDCs and omics. For 9 of them, we were able to find corroborating evidence from previous literature: DEP - serotonin, OXBE - cg27466129, OXBE - dimethylamine, triclosan - leptin, triclosan - serotonin, MBzP - Neu5AC, MEHP - cg20080548, oh-MiNP - kynurenine, oxo-MiNP - 5-oxoproline. We used these associations to explore possible mechanisms between EDCs and health outcomes, and found links to health outcomes for 3 analytes: serotonin and kynurenine in relation to neuro-behavioural development, and leptin in relation to obesity and insulin resistance. Conclusions This multi-omics network analysis at two time points identified biologically relevant molecular signatures related to non-persistent EDC exposure in childhood, suggesting pathways related to neurological and metabolic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Prior to the genome-wide association era, candidate gene studies were a major approach in schizophrenia genetics. In this invited review, we consider the current status of 25 historical candidate genes for schizophrenia (for example, COMT, DISC1, DTNBP1 and NRG1). The initial study for 24 of these genes explicitly evaluated common variant hypotheses about schizophrenia. Our evaluation included a meta-analysis of the candidate gene literature, incorporation of the results of the largest genomic study yet published for schizophrenia, ratings from informed researchers who have published on these genes, and ratings from 24 schizophrenia geneticists. On the basis of current empirical evidence and mostly consensual assessments of informed opinion, it appears that the historical candidate gene literature did not yield clear insights into the genetic basis of schizophrenia. A likely reason why historical candidate gene studies did not achieve their primary aims is inadequate statistical power. However, the considerable efforts embodied in these early studies unquestionably set the stage for current successes in genomic approaches to schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill published nine “viewpoints” to help determine if observed epidemiologic associations are causal. Since then, the “Bradford Hill Criteria” have become the most frequently cited framework for causal inference in epidemiologic studies. However, when Hill published his causal guidelines—just 12~years after the double-helix model for DNA was first suggested and 25~years before the Human Genome Project began—disease causation was understood on a more elementary level than it is today. Advancements in genetics, molecular biology, toxicology, exposure science, and statistics have increased our analytical capabilities for exploring potential cause-and-effect relationships, and have resulted in a greater understanding of the complexity behind human disease onset and progression. These additional tools for causal inference necessitate a re-evaluation of how each Bradford Hill criterion should be interpreted when considering a variety of data types beyond classic epidemiology studies. Herein, we explore the implications of data integration on the interpretation and application of the criteria. Using examples of recently discovered exposure–response associations in human disease, we discuss novel ways by which researchers can apply and interpret the Bradford Hill criteria when considering data gathered using modern molecular techniques, such as epigenetics, biomarkers, mechanistic toxicology, and genotoxicology.},

Maternal urinary metabolite concentrations have been associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigate inflammation as a possible pathway by examining phthalates in association with inflammation biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and a panel of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) in a repeated measures analysis of pregnant women (N = 480). Urinary phthalate metabolites and plasma inflammation biomarkers were measured from samples collected at up to four visits per subject during gestation (median 10, 18, 26, and 35 weeks). Associations were examined using mixed models to account for within-individual correlation of measures. Few statistically significant associations or clear trends were observed, although in full models mono-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) was significantly (percent change with interquartile range increase in exposure [\%Δ] = 8.89, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 3.28, 14.8), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) was suggestively (\%Δ = 6.79, 95\%CI = -1.21, 15.4) associated with IL-6. Overall these findings show little evidence of an association between phthalate exposure and peripheral inflammation in pregnant women. To investigate inflammation as a mechanism of phthalate effects in humans, biomarkers from target tissues or fluids, though difficult to measure in large-scale studies, may be necessary to detect effects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a global public health issue and rates in Puerto Rico are consistently among the highest in the USA. Exposures to environmental contaminants might be a contributing factor. METHODS: In a preliminary analysis from the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) cohort (n\,=\,1090), we investigated the association between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations measured at three study visits (targeted at 20, 24, and 28\,weeks of gestation) individually and averaged over pregnancy with gestational age at delivery and preterm birth. We additionally assessed differences in associations by study visit and among preterm births with a spontaneous delivery. RESULTS: Compared to women in the general USA population, urinary concentrations of metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were higher among pregnant women in Puerto Rico. Interquartile range (IQR) increases in pregnancy-averages of urinary metabolites of DBP and DiBP were associated with shorter duration of gestation and increased odds of preterm birth. An IQR increase in mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of DBP, was associated with 1.55\,days shorter gestation (95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,-2.68, -0.42) and an odds ratio (OR) of 1.42 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.88) for preterm birth. An IQR increase in mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), a metabolite of DiBP, was associated with 1.16\,days shorter gestation (95\% CI\,=\,-2.25, -0.08) and an OR of 1.32 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.71) for preterm birth. Associations were greatest in magnitude for urinary concentrations measured at the second study visit (median 23\,weeks gestation). DiBP metabolite associations were greatest in magnitude in models of spontaneous preterm birth. No associations were detected with other phthalate metabolites, including those of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate. CONCLUSION: Among pregnant women in the PROTECT cohort, DBP and DiBP metabolites were associated with increased odds of preterm birth. These exposures may be contributing to elevated rates of preterm birth observed in Puerto Rico.},

  abstract = {Background: Preterm delivery is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Two-thirds of preterm deliveries are idiopathic. The initiating molecular mechanisms behind spontaneous preterm delivery are unclear. Umbilical cord blood DNA samples are an easy source of material to study the neonatal state at birth. DNA methylation changes can be exploited as markers to identify spontaneous preterm delivery. To identify methylation differences specific to idiopathic preterm delivery, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation changes in 24 umbilical cord blood samples (UCB) using the 450 K Illumina methylation array. After quality control, conclusions were based on 11 term and 11 idiopathic preterm born neonates. The differentially methylated positions (DMPs) specific for preterm/term delivery, neonatal sex, use of oxytocin and mode of initiation of labor were calculated by controlling the FDR p value at 0.05. Results: The analysis identifies 1855 statistically significant DMPs between preterm and term deliveries of which 508 DMPs are also attributable to clinical variables other than preterm versus term delivery. 1347 DMPs are unique to term vs preterm delivery, of which 196 DMPs do not relate to gestational age as such. Pathway analysis indicated enrichment of genes involved in calcium signalling, myometrial contraction and relaxation pathways. The 1151 DMPs that correlate with advancing gestational age (p {$<$} 0.05) include 161 DMPs that match with two previously reported studies on UCB methylation. Additionally, 123 neonatal sex specific DMPs, 97 DMPs specific to the induction of labour and 42 DMPs specific to the mode of initiation of labor were also identified. Conclusion: This study identifies 196 DMPs in UCB DNA of neonates which do not relate to gestational age or any other clinical variable recorded and are specific to idiopathic preterm delivery. Furthermore, 161 DMPs from our study overlap with previously reported studies of which a subset is also reported to be differentially methylated at 18 years of age. A DMP on MYL4, encoding myosin light chain 4, is a robust candidate for the identification of idiopathic preterm labour as it is identified by all 3 independent studies.},

In parallel to the terms `transcriptome' and `proteome', the set of metabolites synthesized by a biological system constitute its `metabolome'. Yet, unlike other functional genomics approaches, the unbiased simultaneous identification and quantification of plant metabolomes has been largely neglected. Until recently, most analyses were restricted to profiling selected classes of compounds, or to fingerprinting metabolic changes without sufficient analytical resolution to determine metabolite levels and identities individually. As a prerequisite for metabolomic analysis, careful consideration of the methods employed for tissue extraction, sample preparation, data acquisition, and data mining must be taken. In this review, the differences among metabolite target analysis, metabolite profiling, and metabolic fingerprinting are clarified, and terms are defined. Current approaches are examined, and potential applications are summarized with a special emphasis on data mining and mathematical modelling of metabolism.},

It is well documented that telomere dysfunction plays a significant role in the initiation of genomic instability during carcinogenesis in human breast cancer. In the present study, we evaluated the genotoxic effect of ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (ethyl-paraben), with and without metabolic activation (S9), in studies following OECD guidelines. We observed a significant increase in genotoxic damage using the Mouse Lymphoma Assay and in vitro micronucleus (MN) tests in the L5178Y cell line in the presence of S9 only after a short exposure. A high frequency of MN was observed in the TK6 cells after a short exposure (3\,h) in the presence of S9 and a long exposure (26\,h) without S9. We found significant increases in the MN frequency and induced chromosomal aberrations in the lymphocytes of only one donor after ethyl-paraben exposure in the presence of S9 after a short exposure. Cytogenetic characterization of the paraben-treated cells demonstrated telomere shortening associated with telomere loss and telomere deletions in L5178Y and TK6 cells and lymphocytes of the paraben sensitive-donor. In a control cohort of 68 human lymphocytes, telomere length and telomere aberrations were age-dependent and showed high inter-individual variation. This study is the first to link telomere shortening and the genotoxic effect of ethyl paraben in the presence of S9 and raises the possibility that telomere shortening may be a proxy for underlying inter-individual sensitivity to ethyl-paraben.

As such, the ability to simulate data represents a critical set of skills that epidemiologists should use to better understand epidemiologic concepts and ensure that they have the tools to continue to self-teach even when their formal instruction ends. Simulation methods are not always taught in epidemiology methods courses, whereas causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) often are. Therefore, this paper details an approach to building simulations from DAGs and provides examples and code for learning to perform simulations. We recommend using very simple DAGs to learn the procedures and code necessary to set up a simulation that builds on key concepts frequently of interest to epidemiologists (e.g., mediation, confounding bias, M bias). We believe that following this approach will allow epidemiologists to gain confidence with a critical skill set that may in turn have a positive impact on how they conduct future epidemiologic studies.},

  abstract = {In a real-world observational data analysis setting, guessing the true model specification can be difficult for an analyst. Unfortunately, correct model specification is a core assumption for treatment effect estimation methods such as propensity score methods, G-computation, and regression techniques. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is an alternative method that allows the use of data-adaptive and machine learning algorithms for model fitting. TMLE therefore does not require strict assumptions about the model specification but preserves the validity of the inference. Multiple studies have shown that TMLE outperforms other methods in certain real-world settings, making it a useful and potentially superior algorithm for causal inference. However, there is a lack of accessible resources for practitioners to understand the implementation. Hence the TMLE framework is the least-used method by practitioners in epidemiology literature. Recently a few accessible articles have been published, but they focus only on binary outcomes and demonstrations are done mainly with simulated data. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by providing a step-by-step TMLE implementation guide for a continuous outcome, using an openly accessible clinical dataset.},

This paper criticizes the practice, building upon recent critiques. 2 Regression of residuals is often used as an alternative to multiple regression, often with the aim of controlling for confounding variables. When correlations exist between independent variables, as is generally the case with ecological datasets, this procedure leads to biased parameter estimates. Standard multiple regression, by contrast, yields unbiased parameter estimates. 3 In multiple regression parameters are estimated controlling for the effects of the other variables in the model, and thus multiple regression achieves what residual regression claims to do. 4 Several measures of correlation exist that differ in the way that variance is partitioned among independent variables. These can be estimated multiply, or sequentially if reasons exist for estimating effects of variables in a hierarchical manner.},

By assessing 1,183 plasma metabolites in 1,368 extensively phenotyped individuals from the LifeLines-DEEP and GoNL cohorts, we quantified the proportion of inter-individual variation of the plasma metabolome explained by different factors and characterized 605 metabolites that are dominantly driven by diet, 85 driven by the gut microbiome, and 56 driven by genetics. We also developed a model that reflects the quality of an individual’s diet using 76 mostly diet-driven metabolites. By applying Mendelian randomization (MR) and mediation analyses, we reveal putative causal relationships between diet, gut microbiome and metabolites. For example, MR supports the causal effect of Eubacterium rectale in decreasing plasma levels of toxic p-cresol and p-cresol sulfate, two metabolites related to cardiometabolic risk and chronic kidney disease. We further followed-up the plasma metabolome profile in 311 individuals after 4 years and observe that the metabolites with more variance explained by genetics, microbiome or diet are also more temporarily stable. Altogether, our characterization of the dominant drivers of plasma metabolites can help in the design of therapeutic approaches that target the diet, human genome, or gut microbiome to drive a healthy metabolome.},

  abstract = {Prenatal exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) has been associated with different neurodevelopmental outcomes across different cohorts. A phenotypic approach may address some of these differences by incorporating information across scales and accounting for the complex correlational structure of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additionally, Bayesian hierarchical modeling can account for confounding by collinear co-exposures. We use this framework to examine associations between prenatal exposure to OPs and behavior, executive functioning, and IQ assessed at age 6–9 years in a cohort of 404 mother/infant pairs recruited during pregnancy. We derived phenotypes of neurodevelopment with a factor analysis, and estimated associations between OP metabolites and these phenotypes in Bayesian hierarchical models for exposure mixtures. We report seven factors: 1) Impulsivity and Externalizing, 2) Executive Functioning, 3) Internalizing, 4) Perceptual Reasoning, 5) Adaptability, 6) Processing Speed, and 7) Verbal Intelligence. These, along with the Working Memory Index, were standardized and scaled so that positive values reflected positive attributes and negative values represented adverse outcomes. Standardized dimethylphosphate metabolites were negatively associated with Internalizing factor scores (β\^ − 0.13, 95\% CI − 0.26, 0.00) but positively associated with Executive Functioning factor scores (β\^ 0.18, 95\% CI 0.04, 0.31). Standardized diethylphosphate metabolites were negatively associated with the Working Memory Index (β\^ − 0.17, 95\% CI − 0.33, − 0.03). Associations with factor scores were generally stronger and more precise than associations with individual instrument-specific items. Factor analysis of outcomes may provide some advantages in etiological studies of childhood neurodevelopment by incorporating information across scales to reduce dimensionality and improve precision.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal data is commonly analysed to inform prevention policies for diseases that may develop throughout life. Commonly methods interpret the longitudinal data as a series of discrete measurements or as continuous patterns. Some of the latter methods condition on the outcome, aiming to capture ‘average’ patterns within outcome groups, while others capture individual-level pattern features before relating these to the outcome. Conditioning on the outcome may prevent meaningful interpretation. Repeated measurements of a longitudinal exposure (weight) and later outcome (glycated haemoglobin levels) were simulated to match three scenarios: one with no causal relationship between growth rate and glycated haemoglobin; two with a positive causal effect of growth rate on glycated haemoglobin. Two methods that condition on the outcome and one that did not were applied to the data in 1000 simulations. The interpretation of the two-step method matched the simulation in all causal scenarios, but that of the methods conditioning on the outcome did not. Methods that condition on the outcome do not accurately represent a causal relationship between a longitudinal pattern and outcome. Researchers considering longitudinal data should carefully determine if they wish to analyse longitudinal data as a series of discrete time points or by extracting pattern features.},

To date a limited range of species (macroinvertebrates, fish, and birds), habitats (lakes, rivers, and sea), and compounds (benzophenones and camphors) have been investigated. As a consequence there is not enough data enabling reliable understanding of the global distribution and effect of UV filters on ecosystems. Both liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based methods have been developed and applied to the trace analysis of these pollutants in biota, enabling the required selectivity and sensitivity. As expected, the most lipophilic compounds occur most frequently with concentrations up to 7112~ng~g−1 lipids in mussels and 3100~ng~g−1 lipids (homosalate) in fish. High concentrations have also been reported for 4-methylbenzilidenecamphor (up to 1800~ng~g−1 lipids) and octocrylene (2400~ng~g−1 lipids). Many fewer studies have evaluated the potential bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both fresh and marine water and terrestrial food webs. Estimated biomagnification factors suggest biomagnification in predator–prey pairs, for example bird–fish and fish–invertebrates. Ecotoxicological data and preliminary environmental assessment of the risk of UV filters are also included and discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple omics technologies are increasingly applied to detect early, subtle molecular responses to environmental stressors for future disease risk prevention. However, there is an urgent need for further evaluation of stability and variability of omics profiles in healthy individuals, especially during childhood. METHODS: We aimed to estimate intra-, inter-individual and cohort variability of multi-omics profiles (blood DNA methylation, gene expression, miRNA, proteins and serum and urine metabolites) measured 6 months apart in 156 healthy children from five European countries. We further performed a multi-omics network analysis to establish clusters of co-varying omics features and assessed the contribution of key variables (including biological traits and sample collection parameters) to omics variability. RESULTS: All omics displayed a large range of intra- and inter-individual variability depending on each omics feature, although all presented a highest median intra-individual variability. DNA methylation was the most stable profile (median 37.6\% inter-individual variability) while gene expression was the least stable (6.6\%). Among the least stable features, we identified 1\% cross-omics co-variation between CpGs and metabolites (e.g. glucose and CpGs related to obesity and type 2 diabetes). Explanatory variables, including age and body mass index (BMI), explained up to 9\% of serum metabolite variability. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation and targeted serum metabolomics are the most reliable omics to implement in single time-point measurements in large cross-sectional studies. In the case of metabolomics, sample collection and individual traits (e.g. BMI) are important parameters to control for improved comparability, at the study design or analysis stage. This study will be valuable for the design and interpretation of epidemiological studies that aim to link omics signatures to disease, environmental exposures, or both.},

  abstract = {Every day we are exposed to a cocktail of anthropogenic compounds many of which are biologically active and capable of inducing negative effects. The simplest way to monitor contaminants in a population is via human biomonitoring (HBM), however conventional targeted approaches require foreknowledge of chemicals of concern, often have compound specific extractions and provide information only for those compounds. This study developed an extraction process for human biomarkers of interest (BoE) in urine that is less compound specific. Combining this with an ultra-high resolution mass spectrometer capable of operating in full scan, and a suspect and non-targeted analysis (SS/NTA) approach, this method provides a more holistic characterization of human exposure. Sample preparation development was based on enzymatically hydrolysed urine spiked with 34 native standards and extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE). HRMS data was processed by MzMine2 and 80\% of standards were identified in the final data matrix using typical NTA data processing procedures. The Human Biomonitoring for Europe initiative (HBM4EU) aims to study the exposure of citizens to chemicals and potentially associated health effects. One objective of this project has been to build a network of laboratories able to answer to the requirements of European human biomonitoring studies. Within the HBM4EU quality assurance and quality control scheme (QA/QC), a number of interlaboratory comparison investigations (ICIs) and external quality assurance schemes (EQUASs) were organized to ensure data consistency, comparability and reliability. Bisphenols are among the prioritized substance groups in HBM4EU, including bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) in human urine. In four rounds of ICI/EQUAS, two target concentration levels were considered, related to around P25 and P95 of the typical exposure distribution observed in the European general population. Special attention was paid to the conjugated phase II metabolites known to be most dominant in samples of environmentally exposed individuals, through the analysis of both native samples and samples fortified with glucuronide forms. For the low level, the average percentage of satisfactory results across the four rounds was 83\% for BPA, 71\% for BPS and 62\% for BPF. For the high level, the percentages of satisfactory results increased to 93\% for BPA, 89\% for BPS and 86\% for BPF. 24 out of 32 participating laboratories (75\%) were approved for the analyses of BPA in the HBM4EU project according to the defined criterion of Z-scores for both low and high concentration levels in at least two ICI/EQUAS rounds. For BPS and BPF, the number of qualified laboratories was 18 out of 27 (67\%) and 13 out of 28 (46\%), respectively. These results demonstrate a strong analytical capability for BPA and BPS in Europe, while improvements may be needed for BPF. The Flemish Environment and Health Study (FLEHS) collects information on internal exposure to a broad range of environmental chemicals in the general population in Flanders, the Northern region of Belgium. The aim is to establish biomonitoring exposure distributions for the general population in support of public health and environmental policy, environmental risk assessment and risk management decisions. In 2017–2018, urine and blood samples were collected from 428 teenagers by a stratified clustered two stage randomized design. Samples were analyzed for a broad range of biomarkers related to exposure to chlorinated and newer pesticides, brominated and organophosphate flame retardants (BFR/OPFR), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenols, phthalates and alternative plasticizers, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, metals and trace elements. The geometric mean levels and percentiles of the distribution were estimated for each biomarker, for the whole study population and following stratification for sex, the household educational attainment and the residence area's urbanicity. Geometric means of biomarkers of lead, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), PCBs, PAHs, regulated phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) were lower than in the previous FLEHS cycles. Most biomarker levels were below health-based guidance values (HB-GVs). However, HB-GVs of urinary arsenic, blood lead, blood cadmium, sum of serum perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoro-1-hexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and the urinary pyrethroid metabolite (3-PBA) were exceeded in respectively 25\%, 12\%, 39.5\%, 10\% and 22\% of the teenagers. These results suggest that the levels of exposure in the Flemish population to some environmental chemicals might be of concern. At the same time, we noticed that biomarkers for BPA substitutes, metabolites of OPFRs, an expanded list of PFAS, glyphosate and its metabolite could be measured in substantial proportions of participants. Interpretation of these levels in a health-risk context remains uncertain as HB-GVs are lacking. Household educational attainment and residential urbanicity were significant exposure determinants for many biomarkers and could influence specific biomarker levels up to 70\% as shown by multiple regression analysis. The research consortium also took care of the broader external communication of results with participants, policy makers, professional groups and civil society organizations. Our study demonstrated that teenagers are exposed to a wide range of chemicals, it demonstrates the success of public policies to reduce exposure but also points to concern and further priorities and needs for follow up. Obtaining holistic information about health and health determinants at the population level should also include data on environmental risk factors of health. So far, only a few countries have combined, at the national level, health and human biomonitoring (HBM) surveys to collect extensive information on health, lifestyles, biological health determinants and environmental exposures. This paper will provide guidelines on how to combine health and HBM surveys and what is the added value of doing so. Health and HBM surveys utilize similar infrastructure and data collection methods including questionnaires, collection and analysis of biological samples, and objective health measurements. There are many overlapping or comparable steps in these two survey types. At the European level, detailed protocols for conducting a health examination survey or HBM study exists separately but there is no protocol for a combined survey available by now. Our recommendations for combined health and HBM surveys focus on a cross-sectional survey on general population aged 6–79 years. To avoid unnecessary participant burden, for the selection of included measurements basic principle would be to ensure that results of the measurements have a public health relevance and clear interpretation. Combining health and HBM surveys into one survey would produce an extensive database for research to support policy decisions in many fields such as public health and chemical regulations. Combined surveys are cost-effective as only one infrastructure is needed to collect information and recruit participants. In the first national human biomonitoring study in the Slovenian population of adults (18–49 years), including men (n = 297) and lactating primiparous women (n = 304), exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was evaluated. Nine urinary metabolites of four parent PAHs were determined. These included 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHPYR), 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OHNAP), 2-hydroxyphenanthrene (2-OHPHE), 3-hydroxyphenanthrene (3-OHPHE), 4-hydroxyphenanthrene (4-OHPHE), a combination of 2-hydroxyfluorene and 3-hydroxyfluorene (2/3-OHFLU) and a combination of 1-hydroxyphenanthrene and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene (1/9-OHPHE). For comparison, the analysed phenanthrene metabolites were reported as a sum (ΣOHPHE = 1/9-OHPHE + 2-OHPHE + 3-OHPHE + 4-OHPHE) and all the analysed PAH metabolites were reported as a sum (ΣOHPAH = 1-OHPYR + 2/3-OHFLU + 2-OHNAP + ΣOHPHE). All metabolites or their combinations were determined in more than 91\% of the samples, except 4-OHPHE, which was determined in only 5\% of the samples. The highest concentration was found for 2-OHNAP. This was followed by 2/3-OHFLU and the phenanthrene metabolites, while the lowest concentration was determined for 1-OHPYR. Among the phenanthrene metabolites, the highest concentration was determined for 2-OHPHE, followed by 1/9-OHPHE and then by 3-OHPHE. Values in units of volume and values adjusted for specific gravity were significantly higher in men than in lactating primiparous women for all metabolites, whereas values in units adjusted for creatinine were generally higher in lactating primiparous women than in men. The difference between the two study groups, men and lactating primiparous women, was no longer significant in statistical models adjusted for specific gravity, suggesting that smoking, wood-burning exposure, and/or education largely explained the difference in PAH exposure in both study groups. For most metabolites, predictors of exposure were less significant in lactating primiparous women than in men. Also, site-specific patterns of exposure were observed, with additional predictors identified in certain areas, namely, proximity to roads and release of particulate matter (PM10) from industry. The time of year in which sampling took place appeared to be an important determinant in urban areas and in the case of participants who used wood for heating. Specific dietary factors could not be identified, as the study questionnaire did not include information on PAH-related diet. Despite the low number of paired partners (women and men living in the same household, n = 84), significant positive correlations for all metabolites were observed. This indicated that 31\%–56\% of variability in exposure could be explained by shared exposure to sources within the households (such as diet and wood-burning-related determinants). The pan-European human biomonitoring initiative HBM4EU targets the harmonization of human biomonitoring (HBM) procedures and data for both environmental and occupational exposure, including chromium. The determination of chromium in urine (U-Cr), plasma (P-Cr) and whole blood (WB-Cr) is a common HBM application in employees occupationally exposed to chromium (VI) compounds. European laboratories which have registered as candidate laboratories for chromium analysis within HBM4EU were invited to participate in a quality assurance/qualitycontrol (QA/QC) programme comprising interlaboratory comparison investigations (ICI) for the parameters U-Cr, P-Cr and WB-Cr. Participating laboratories received two samples of different concentrations in each of four rounds and were asked to analyse the samples using their standard analytical procedure. The data were evaluated by the Z-score approach and were reported to the participants after each round. The majority of the 29 participating laboratories obtained satisfactory results, although low limits of quantification were required to quantify chromium concentrations in some of the ICI materials. The robust relative standard deviation of the participants’ results (study RSDR) obtained from all ICI runs ranged from 6 to 16 \% for U-Cr, 7–18 \% for P-Cr and 4–47 \% for WB-Cr. The application of both inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS) appeared appropriate for the determination of chromium in urine, plasma and whole blood with regard to occupational exposure levels. This QA/QC programme succeeded in establishing a network of laboratories with high analytical comparability and accuracy for the analysis of chromium across Europe. The use of human biomonitoring (HBM) as a tool for environmental health policy and research is developing rapidly in Israel. Despite challenges in securing political and financial support for HBM, the Ministry of Health has initiated national HBM studies and has utilized HBM data in environmental health policy decision making. Currently, the Ministry of Health is collecting urine samples from children and adults in the framework of the National Health and Nutrition Study (MABAT), with the goal of ongoing surveillance of population exposure to pesticides and environmental tobacco smoke, and of combining HBM data with data on diet and health behavior. In academic research studies in Israel, biomarkers are used increasingly in environmental epidemiology, including in three active birth cohort studies on adverse health effects of phthalates, brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate pesticides. Future Ministry of Health goals include establishing HBM analytical capabilities, developing a long term national HBM plan for Israel and participating in the proposed HBM4EU project in order to improve data harmonization. One of the lessons learned in Israel is that even in the absence of a formal HBM program, it is possible to collect meaningful HBM data and use it in an ad hoc fashion to support environmental health policy. In this publication the challenges to cope for the aim to obtain innovative biomonitoring methods in our laboratory are visualized for di(2-propylheptyl)phthalate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene, 4-nonylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor, 4,4′-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, and Hexabromocyclododecane. For these substances new specific markers were explored based on animal or human kinetic data with urine being the preferred matrix compared to blood. The determination of these markers was complex in all cases, because the sample preparation as well as the detection by high performance liquid chromatography, capillary gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometers or high resolution mass spectrometry should enable the lowest possible detection limit by use of minimal biological sample volumes. To get a first hint of a possible background level, the analytical methods were applied to urine samples of about 40 persons for each chemical. For Di(2-propylheptyl)phthalate and 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole first results are presented from population biomonitoring. Since 2002, the Flemish Government decided to carry out the Flemish Environment and Health Survey (FLEHS), an extended human biomonitoring (HBM) program, which is integrated in the environmental health policy. Through the FLEHS studies, a vast amount of data such as biomarkers of exposure and effect, exposure-effect associations, time trends and geographical differences, became available to the Flemish policy makers. In order to facilitate the policy interpretation, a phased action-plan was developed collaboratively by FLEHS researchers and policy makers. In this article we look back on more than 15 years of investments of the Flemish government in HBM and reflect on how this large scaled and challenging HBM-initiative contributed to shaping the environmental health policy in Flanders. We used the FLEHS I (2002–2006) and II (2007–2011) results on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the resulting policy actions as an example to illustrate the added value of HBM for policy making. Policy measures for POPs, including source-related regulation (e.g. further optimization and tightening of existing Flemish legislation on open fires), investment in monitoring networks and communication and awareness campaigns, are presented and the added value for environmental health policy is discussed. We also reflect on how HBM can support science and innovation in the environmental monitoring context. Finally, we describe what society can gain from HBM in terms of opportunities for (1) feeding the political and societal debate, (2) stimulating community involvement and (3) empowering participants and citizens. All together, the gained insights and phased action plan showed that next to compliance with high scientific standards, results of the Flemish human biomonitoring campaign could be translated in targeted policy actions even for chemicals that have since long been regulated. Since 1991 a human biomonitoring network has been established in the Czech Republic as part of the Environmental Health Monitoring System, which was set out by the Government Resolution. During the last quarter-century, important data was obtained to characterize exposure to both children and adult populations to significant toxic substances from the environment, to development trends over time, to establish reference values and compare them with existing health-related values. Moreover, the saturation of population with several essential substances as selenium, zinc, copper or iodine has also been monitored. Development of analytical and statistical methods led to increase the capacity building, improvement of QA/QC in analytical laboratories and interpretation of results. The obtained results are translated to policy actions and are used in health risk assessment processes at local and national levels. This paper presents a progress report of the French human biomonitoring (HBM) program established in 2010. This program has been designed to provide a national representative estimation of the French population’s exposure to various environmental chemicals and to study the determinants of exposure. This program currently consists in two surveys: a perinatal component related to a selection of 4145 pregnant women who have been enrolled in the Elfe cohort (the French Longitudinal Study since Childhood) in 2011, and a general population survey related to adults aged 18–74 years and children as from 6 years (Esteban). The aim of this manuscript is to present highlights of the French human biomonitoring program with particular focus on the prioritization of biomarkers to be analyzed in the program and the selection of biomarkers applied to both program components. The Delphi method was used to establish a consensual list of prioritized biomarkers in 2011. First results of the perinatal component of the French HBM program have shown that the biomarkers prioritized were relevant, as almost all pregnant women were exposed to them. However, for some biomarkers, levels’ decreases have been observed which may partly be explained by measures taken to prohibit some of these chemicals (e.g. atrazine) and by industrial processes evolutions leading to the substitution of others (e.g. bisphenol A, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate/DEHP, dialkyl phosphates). Therefore, the list of biomarkers to be monitored in the French HBM program has been implemented to include some substitutes of biomarkers prioritized in the first instance (e.g. bisphenol S, F). Finally, this method combines rigor and flexibility and helped us to build a prioritized list that will be shared and supported by many if not all actors. Within the European Environment and Health Action Plan an initiative to establish a coherent human biomonitoring approach in Europe was started. The project COPHES (COnsortium to Perform Human biomonitoring on a European Scale ) developed recommendations for a harmonized conduct of a human biomonitoring (HBM) survey which came into action as the pilot study DEMOCOPHES (DEMOnstration of a study to COordinate and Perform Human biomonitoring on a European Scale). Seventeen European countries conducted a survey with harmonized instruments for, inter alia, recruitment, fieldwork and sampling, in autumn/winter 2011/2012. Based on the countries' experiences of conducting the pilot study, following lessons learnt were compiled: the harmonized fieldwork instruments (basic questionnaire, urine and hair sampling) turned out to be very valuable for future HBM surveys on the European scale. A school approach was favoured by most of the countries to recruit school-aged children according to the established guidelines and country specific experiences. To avoid a low participation rate, intensive communication with the involved institutions and possible participants proved to be necessary. The communication material should also include information on exclusion criteria and offered incentives. Telephone contact to the participants the day before fieldwork during the survey can prevent the forgetting of appointments and first morning urine samples. To achieve comparable results on the European scale, training of interviewers in all issues of recruitment, fieldwork and sampling through information material and training sessions is crucial. A survey involving many European countries needs time for preparation and conduct. Materials for quality control prepared for all steps of recruitment, fieldwork and sampling proved to be important to warrant reliable results.},

  abstract = {There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of prenatal phthalate exposure on children's neuropsychological development. We evaluate the association between prenatal phthalate exposure and the cognitive, psychomotor and behavioral development of 367 children at repeated ages in a prospective birth cohort study. We measured phthalate metabolites (sum of four DEHP metabolites – Σ4DEHP, MBzP, MEP, MiBP and MnBP) in urine samples collected during the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy in women participating in the INMA-Sabadell birth cohort study. We assessed cognitive and psychomotor development of their children at 1 and 4 years, and social competence, ADHD symptoms and other behavioral problems at 4 and 7 years. No associations were observed between prenatal phthalate exposure and cognitive and psychomotor scores at the age of 1 year and at the age of 4 years, except for an association between MBzP and lower psychomotor scores (β=−1.49 [95\% confidence interval (CI)=−2.78, −0.21]). Σ4DEHP concentrations were associated with increased social competence scores at 4 years and with reduced ADHD symptoms at age 4 and 7 years. Increasing MEP concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of inattention symptoms at 4 years. No associations were observed for MBzP, MiBP or MnBP in relation to behavioral problems. This study, with multiple phthalate exposure measurements and measures of neuropsychological domains at different ages, suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure does not adversely affect children's cognitive, psychomotor or behavioral development.},

  abstract = {With the expand of the population’s average age, the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders has dramatically increased over the last decades. Alzheimer disease (AD) which is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease is mostly sporadic and primarily characterized by cognitive deficits and neuropathological lesions such as amyloid -β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper- and/or abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein. AD is considered a complex disease that arises from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors, modulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Besides the well-described cognitive decline, AD patients also exhibit metabolic impairments. Metabolic and cognitive perturbations are indeed frequently observed in the Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases (DOHaD) field of research which proposes that environmental perturbations during the perinatal period determine the susceptibility to pathological conditions later in life. In this review, we explored the potential influence of early environmental exposure to risk factors (maternal stress, malnutrition, xenobiotics, chemical factors … ) and the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on the programming of late-onset AD. Animal models indicate that offspring exposed to early-life stress during gestation and/or lactation increase both AD lesions, lead to defects in synaptic plasticity and finally to cognitive impairments. This long-lasting epigenetic programming could be modulated by factors such as nutriceuticals, epigenetic modifiers or psychosocial behaviour, offering thus future therapeutic opportunity to protect from AD development.},

Single chemical in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate causal links between the chemicals and outcomes, but such studies do not represent human exposure to environmental mixtures. One way of summarizing the effect of the joint action of chemical mixtures is through an empirically weighted index using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. My Nutrition Index (MNI) is a metric of overall dietary nutrition based on guideline values, including for pregnant women. Our objective is to demonstrate the use of an index as a metric for more causally linking human exposure to health outcomes using observational data. We use both a WQS index of 26 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and MNI using data from the SELMA pregnancy cohort to conduct causal inference using g-computation with counterfactuals for assumed either reduced prenatal EDC exposures or improved prenatal nutrition. Reducing the EDC exposure using the WQS index as a metric or improving dietary nutrition using MNI as a metric, the counterfactuals in a causal inference with one SD change indicate significant improvement in cognitive function. Evaluation of such a strategy may support decision makers for risk management of EDCs and individual choices for improving dietary nutrition.},

  abstract = {Multiple comparisons and small sample size, common characteristics of many types of “Big Data” including those that are produced by genomic studies, present specific challenges that affect reliability of inference. Use of multiple testing procedures necessitates calculation of very small tail probabilities of a test statistic distribution. Results based on large deviation theory provide a formal condition that is necessary to guarantee error rate control given practical sample sizes, linking the number of tests and the sample size; this condition, however, is rarely satisfied. Using methods that are based on Edgeworth expansions (relying especially on the work of Peter Hall), we explore the impact of departures of sampling distributions from typical assumptions on actual error rates. Our investigation illustrates how far the actual error rates can be from the declared nominal levels, suggesting potentially wide-spread problems with error rate control, specifically excessive false positives. This is an important factor that contributes to “reproducibility crisis”. We also review some other commonly used methods (such as permutation and methods based on finite sampling inequalities) in their application to multiple testing/small sample data. We point out that Edgeworth expansions, providing higher order approximations to the sampling distribution, offer a promising direction for data analysis that could improve reliability of studies relying on large numbers of comparisons with modest sample sizes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous methods exist to analyze complex environmental mixtures in health studies. As an illustration of the different uses of mixture methods, we employed methods geared toward distinct research questions concerning persistent organic chemicals (POPs) as a mixture and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as an outcome. METHODS: With information on 18 POPs and LTL among 1,003 U.S. adults (NHANES, 2001-2002), we used unsupervised methods including clustering to identify profiles of similarly exposed participants, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify common exposure patterns. We also employed supervised learning techniques, including penalized, weighted quantile sum (WQS), and Bayesian kernel machine (BKMR) regressions, to identify potentially toxic agents, and characterize nonlinear associations, interactions, and the overall mixture effect. RESULTS: Clustering separated participants into high, medium, and low POP exposure groups; longer log-LTL was found among those with high exposure. The first PCA component represented overall POP exposure and was positively associated with log-LTL. Two EFA factors, one representing furans and the other PCBs 126 and 118, were positively associated with log-LTL. Penalized regression methods selected three congeners in common (PCB 126, PCB 118, and furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf) as potentially toxic agents. WQS found a positive overall effect of the POP mixture and identified six POPs as potentially toxic agents (furans 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hxcdf, 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdf, and PCBs 99, 126, 169). BKMR found a positive linear association with furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, suggestive evidence of linear associations with PCBs 126 and 169, and a positive overall effect of the mixture, but no interactions among congeners. CONCLUSIONS: Using different methods, we identified patterns of POP exposure, potentially toxic agents, the absence of interaction, and estimated the overall mixture effect. These applications and results may serve as a guide for mixture method selection based on specific research questions.},

  abstract = {Background The recent evidence of the short-term impact of air pollution on youth cognitive functions is based primarily on observational studies. Objectives We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether purifying the air of the classrooms produced short-term changes in attention processes of adolescents. Methods We recruited a total of 2,123 adolescents (13–16~years old) in 33 high schools in Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain). In each school, adolescents from each class were randomly split into two equal-sized groups and assigned to two different classrooms. A set of two air cleaner devices with the same appearance (one recirculating and filtrating the air and the other only recirculating the air) was used. Each one of the devices was placed at random at one of the two classrooms. Students were masked to intervention allocation and had to complete several computerized activities for 1.5~h, including an attention test (Flanker task) to be performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. The response speed consistency, expressed as hit reaction time standard error (HRT-SE, in ms), was measured as the primary outcome. Analyses were conducted using conditional linear regressions with classroom as strata, adjusted for variables that may differ from one class to another such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentration. Results Average levels of PM2.5 and black carbon throughout the 1.5~h of experiment were 89\% and 87\%, respectively, lower in the classrooms with air cleaner than in the control classrooms. No differences were found in the median of HRT-SE between classrooms with cleaned air and normal air (percent change: 1.37\%, 95\% confidence interval: −2.81\%, 5.56\%). Sensitivity analyses with secondary attention outcomes resulted in similar findings. Conclusions Cleaning the air of a classroom to reduce exposure to air pollutants for 1.5~h did not have an impact on the attention function of adolescents. Still, in light of previous evidence suggesting an association between air pollution and attention, further experimental studies should explore other short-term timescales of exposure and age ranges.},

  abstract = {Social epidemiology aims to identify social structural risk factors, thus informing targets and timing of interventions. Ascertaining which interventions will be most effective and when they should be implemented is challenging because social conditions vary across the life course and are subject to time-varying confounding. Marginal structural models (MSMs) may be useful but can present unique challenges when studying social epidemiologic exposures over the life course. We describe selected MSMs corresponding to common theoretical life-course models and identify key issues for consideration related to time-varying confounding and late study enrollment. Using simulated data mimicking a cohort study evaluating the effects of depression in early, mid-, and late life on late-life stroke risk, we examined whether and when specific study characteristics and analytical strategies may induce bias. In the context of time-varying confounding, inverse-probability-weighted estimation of correctly specified MSMs accurately estimated the target causal effects, while conventional regression models showed significant bias. When no measure of early-life depression was available, neither MSMs nor conventional models were unbiased, due to confounding by early-life depression. To inform interventions, researchers need to identify timing of effects and consider whether missing data regarding exposures earlier in life may lead to biased estimates.},

This advice would handicap research on many questions related to the determinants of growth, aging, disease onset, and disease progression.Many questions in epidemiology and clinical research address determinants of how health changes over time. As Tennant et al. note, the preferred analysis to evaluate determinants of change depends on both the substantive situation and the study design. The choice of analysis is best served by considering the causal estimands of interest, the causal structure of the specific setting, and the assumptions under which alternative analyses would deliver unbiased estimates. Tennant attempts to add to a large literature, including much written about Lord’s paradox, with work by Pearl2 of particular relevance.

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the PDP by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data-generating model. Through simulated examples and real datasets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

  abstract = {The Endocrine Society's first Scientific Statement in 2009 provided a wake-up call to the scientific community about how environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) affect health and disease. Five years later, a substantially larger body of literature has solidified our understanding of plausible mechanisms underlying EDC actions and how exposures in animals and humans—especially during development—may lay the foundations for disease later in life. At this point in history, we have much stronger knowledge about how EDCs alter gene-environment interactions via physiological, cellular, molecular, and epigenetic changes, thereby producing effects in exposed individuals as well as their descendants. Causal links between exposure and manifestation of disease are substantiated by experimental animal models and are consistent with correlative epidemiological data in humans. There are several caveats because differences in how experimental animal work is conducted can lead to difficulties in drawing broad conclusions, and we must continue to be cautious about inferring causality in humans. In this second Scientific Statement, we reviewed the literature on a subset of topics for which the translational evidence is strongest: 1) obesity and diabetes; 2) female reproduction; 3) male reproduction; 4) hormone-sensitive cancers in females; 5) prostate; 6) thyroid; and 7) neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine systems. Our inclusion criteria for studies were those conducted predominantly in the past 5 years deemed to be of high quality based on appropriate negative and positive control groups or populations, adequate sample size and experimental design, and mammalian animal studies with exposure levels in a range that was relevant to humans. We also focused on studies using the developmental origins of health and disease model. No report was excluded based on a positive or negative effect of the EDC exposure. The bulk of the results across the board strengthen the evidence for endocrine health-related actions of EDCs. Based on this much more complete understanding of the endocrine principles by which EDCs act, including nonmonotonic dose-responses, low-dose effects, and developmental vulnerability, these findings can be much better translated to human health. Armed with this information, researchers, physicians, and other healthcare providers can guide regulators and policymakers as they make responsible decisions.},

Industrial chemicals that injure the developing brain are among the known causes for this rise in prevalence. In 2006, we did a systematic review and identified five industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants: lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene. Since 2006, epidemiological studies have documented six additional developmental neurotoxicants-manganese, fluoride, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We postulate that even more neurotoxicants remain undiscovered. To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity. To coordinate these efforts and to accelerate translation of science into prevention, we propose the urgent formation of a new international clearinghouse.},

  abstract = {The extent to which postnatal methylmercury exposure contributes to neurobehavioral delays is uncertain. Confounding may occur because the child's dietary exposure likely correlates with the mother's. This conundrum was examined in the Faroese birth cohort 1 born in 1986–1987. Exposure parameters included mercury concentrations in maternal hair at parturition, cord blood, and child blood and hair at the age-7 clinical examination (N=923). In regression analyses, the child's current blood-mercury at age 7 (N=694) showed only weak associations with the neuropsychological test variables, but visuospatial memory revealed a significant negative association. Mutual adjustment caused decreases of the apparent effect of the prenatal exposure. However, such adjustment may lead to underestimations due to the presence of correlated, error-prone exposure variables. In structural equation models, all methylmercury exposure parameters were instead entered into a latent exposure variable that reflected the total methylmercury load. This latent exposure showed significant associations with neurodevelopmental deficits, with prenatal exposure providing the main information. However, postnatal methylmercury exposure appeared to contribute to neurotoxic effects, in particular in regard to visuospatial processing and memory. Thus, addition in the regression analysis of exposure information obtained at a different point in time was not informative and should be avoided. Further studies with better information on exposure profiles are needed to characterize the effects of postnatal methylmercury exposure.},

Most of these studies are analysed either by fitting a risk-regression model with all exposures forced in the model, or by using a preliminary-testing algorithm, such as stepwise regression, to produce a smaller model. Research indicates that hierarchical modelling methods can outperform these conventional approaches. I here review these methods and compare two hierarchical methods, empirical-Bayes regression and a variant I call 'semi-Bayes' regression, to full-model maximum likelihood and to model reduction by preliminary testing. I then present a simulation study of logistic-regression analysis of weak exposure effects to illustrate the type of accuracy gains one may expect from hierarchical methods. Finally, I compare the performance of the methods in a problem of predicting neonatal mortality rates. Based on the literature to date, I suggest that hierarchical methods should become part of the standard approaches to multiple-exposure studies.},

Learning from these data necessitates acknowledging potential sources of bias, and specifying appropriate mitigation strategies. This paper demonstrates how Targeted Learning informs different aspects of SAP development, including explicit representation of intercurrent events. Guiding principles are to 1) define the target parameter of interest separately from the model or estimation procedure; and 2) utilize targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) and super learning for causal inference. These flexible methodologies can be entirely pre-specified while remaining data adaptive; and 3) carry out a non-parametric sensitivity analysis to evaluate the plausibility of a causal interpretation of the estimated treatment effect, and its stability with respect to violations of underlying casual assumptions. The roadmap promotes the principals and practices set forth in the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guideline.

Extracting reliable evidence from real-world data (RWD) is often complicated by a lack of treatment randomization, potential intercurrent events, and informative loss to follow up. Targeted Learning (TL) is a sub-field of statistics that provides a rigorous framework to help address these challenges. The TL Roadmap offers a step-by-step guide to generating valid evidence and assessing its reliability. Following these steps produces an extensive amount of information for assessing whether the study provides reliable scientific evidence in support regulatory decision making. This paper presents two case studies that illustrate the utility of following the roadmap. We use targeted minimum loss-based estimation combined with super learning to estimate causal effects. We also compared these findings with those obtained from an unadjusted analysis, propensity score matching, and inverse probability weighting. Non-parametric sensitivity analyses illuminate how departures from (untestable) causal assumptions would affect point estimates and confidence interval bounds that would impact the substantive conclusion drawn from the study. TL's thorough approach to learning from data provides transparency, allowing trust in RWE to be earned whenever it is warranted.},

It is a complex process, requiring multiple steps, iterations, and collaborations with domain experts. Analysts often rely on visualizations to evaluate the accuracy of each step. However, existing visualization toolkits are not designed to support the entire causal inference process within computational environments familiar to analysts. In this paper, we address this gap with Causalvis, a Python visualization package for causal inference. Working closely with causal inference experts, we adopted an iterative design process to develop four interactive visualization modules to support causal inference analysis tasks. The modules are then presented back to the experts for feedback and evaluation. We found that Causalvis effectively supported the iterative causal inference process. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing visualizations for causal inference, particularly for tasks of communication and collaboration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies have indicated that maternal prenatal substance use may be associated with offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) via intrauterine effects. We measured associations between prenatal smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption with childhood ADHD symptoms accounting for shared familial factors. DESIGN: First, we used a negative control design comparing maternal and paternal substance use. Three models were used for negative control analyses: unadjusted (without confounders), adjusted (including confounders) and mutually adjusted (including confounders and partner's substance use). The results were meta-analysed across the cohorts. Secondly, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) as proxies for exposures. Maternal PRS for smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption were regressed against ADHD symptoms. We triangulated the results across the two approaches to infer causality. SETTING: We used data from three longitudinal pregnancy cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the United Kingdom, Generation R study (GenR) in the Netherlands and Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study (MoBa) in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: Phenotype data available for children were: NALSPAC \,=\,5455-7751; NGENR \,=\,1537-3119; NMOBA \,=\,28\,053-42\,206. Genotype data available for mothers was: NALSPAC \,=\,7074; NMOBA \,=\,14\,583. MEASUREMENTS: A measure of offspring ADHD symptoms at age 7-8~years was derived by dichotomizing scores from questionnaires and parental self-reported prenatal substance use was measured at the second pregnancy trimester. FINDINGS: The pooled estimate for maternal prenatal substance use showed an association with total ADHD symptoms [odds ratio (OR)SMOKING \,=\,1.11, 95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,1.00-1.23; ORALCOHOL \,=\,1.27, 95\% CI\,=\,1.08-1.49; ORCAFFEINE \,=\,1.05, 95\% CI\,=\,1.00-1.11], while not for fathers (ORSMOKING \,=\,1.03, 95\% CI\,=\,0.95-1.13; ORALCOHOL \,=\,0.83, 95\% CI\,=\,0.47-1.48; ORCAFFEINE \,=\,1.02, 95\% CI\,=\,0.97-1.07). However, maternal associations did not persist in sensitivity analyses (substance use before pregnancy, adjustment for maternal ADHD symptoms in MoBa). The PRS analyses were inconclusive for an association in ALSPAC or MoBa. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no causal intrauterine effect of maternal prenatal substance use on offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background Avoiding “causal” language with observational study designs is common publication practice, often justified as being a more cautious approach to interpretation. We aimed to i) estimate the degree to which causality was implied by both the language linking exposures to outcomes and by action recommendations in the high-profile health literature, ii) examine disconnects between language and recommendations, iii) identify which linking phrases were most common, and iv) generate estimates by which these phrases imply causality. Methods We identified 18 of the most prominent general medical/public health/epidemiology journals, and searched and screened for articles published from 2010 to 2019 that investigated exposure/outcome pairs until we reached 65 non-RCT articles per journal (n=1,170). Two independent reviewers and an arbitrating reviewer rated the degree to which they believed causality had been implied by the language in abstracts based on written guidance. Reviewers then rated causal implications of linking words in isolation. For comparison, additional review was performed for full texts and for a secondary sample of RCTs. Results Reviewers rated the causal implication of the sentence and phrase linking the exposure and outcome as None (i.e., makes no causal implication) in 13.8\%, Weak in 34.2\%, Moderate in 33.2\%, and Strong in 18.7\% of abstracts. Reviewers identified an action recommendation in 34.2\% of abstracts. Of these action recommendations, reviewers rated the causal implications as None in 5.3\%, Weak in 19.0\%, Moderate in 42.8\% and Strong in 33.0\% of cases. The implied causality of action recommendations was often higher than the implied causality of linking sentences (44.5\%) or commensurate (40.3\%), with 15.3\% being weaker. The most common linking word root identified in abstracts was “associate” (n=535/1,170; 45.7\%) (e.g. “association,” “associated,” etc). There were only 16 (1.4\%) abstracts using “cause” in the linking or modifying phrases. Reviewer ratings for causal implications of word roots were highly heterogeneous, including those commonly considered non-causal. Discussion We found substantial disconnects between causal implications used to link an exposure to an outcome and the action implications made. This undercuts common assumptions about what words are often considered non-causal and that policing them eliminates causal implications. We recommend that instead of policing words, editors, researchers, and communicators should increase efforts at making research questions, as well as the potential of studies to answer them, more transparent.},

  abstract = {Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent commonly found in a variety of personal care products and cosmetics. TCS readily enters the environment through wastewater and is detected in human plasma, urine, and breast milk due to its widespread use. Studies have implicated TCS as a disruptor of thyroid and estrogen signaling; therefore, research examining the developmental effects of TCS is warranted. In this study, we used embryonic zebrafish to investigate the developmental toxicity and potential mechanism of action of TCS. Embryos were exposed to graded concentrations of TCS from 6 to 120hours post-fertilization (hpf) and the concentration where 80\% of the animals had mortality or morbidity at 120hpf (EC80) was calculated. Transcriptomic profiling was conducted on embryos exposed to the EC80 (7.37μM). We identified a total of 922 significant differentially expressed transcripts (FDR adjusted P-value≤0.05; fold change ≥2). Pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses identified biological networks and transcriptional hubs involving normal liver functioning, suggesting TCS may be hepatotoxic in zebrafish. Tissue-specific gene enrichment analysis further supported the role of the liver as a target organ for TCS toxicity. We also examined the in vitro bioactivity profile of TCS reported by the ToxCast screening program. TCS had a diverse bioactivity profile and was a hit in 217 of the 385 assay endpoints we identified. We observed similarities in gene expression and hepatic steatosis assays; however, hit data for TCS were more concordant with the hypothesized CAR/PXR activity of TCS from rodent and human in vitro studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) is a leading neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide; however, few modifiable risk factors have been identified. Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are ubiquitous chemical compounds that are increasingly prevalent as a replacement for other regulated chemicals. Current research has linked OPEs to neurodevelopmental deficits. The purpose of this study was to assess gestational OPE exposure on clinically-assessed ADHD in children at age 3 years. METHODS: In this nested case-control study within the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort study, we evaluated the impact of OPE exposure at 17 weeks' gestation on preschool-age ADHD. Between 2007 and 2011, 260 ADHD cases were identified using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and compared to a birth-year-stratified control group of 549 children. We categorized bis(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP) and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) as values~{$<~$}limit of detection (LOD) (BBOEP N~=~386, BDCIPP N~=~632), ≥LOD but~{$<~$}limit of quantification (LOQ) (BBOEP N~=~413; BDCIPP N~=~75), or above LOQ (BBOEP N~=~70; BDCIPP N~=~102). Diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) and di-n-butyl phosphate (DnBP) were categorized as quartiles and also modeled with a log10 linear term. We estimated multivariable adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using logistic regression and examined modification by sex using an augmented product term approach. RESULTS: Mothers in the 3rd DnBP quartile had 1.71 times the odds of having a child with ADHD compared to the 1st quartile (95\%CI: 1.13, 2.58); a similar trend was observed for log10 DnBP and ADHD. Mothers with BDCIPP~≥~LOD but~{$<~$}LOQ had 1.39 times the odds of having a child with ADHD compared to those with BDCIPP~{$<~$}LOD (95\%CI: 0.83, 2.31). Girls had lower odds of ADHD with increasing BBOEP exposure (log10 OR: 0.55 (95\%CI: 0.37, 0.93), however boys had a weakly increased odds (log10 OR: 1.25 (95\%CI: 0.74, 2.11) p-interaction~=~0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: We found modest increased odds of preschool ADHD with higher DnBP and BDCIPP exposure.},

  abstract = {The goal of much observational research is to identify risk factors that have a causal effect on health and social outcomes. However, observational data are subject to biases from confounding, selection and measurement, which can result in an underestimate or overestimate of the effect of interest. Various advanced statistical approaches exist that offer certain advantages in terms of addressing these potential biases. However, although these statistical approaches have different underlying statistical assumptions, in practice they cannot always completely remove key sources of bias; therefore, using design-based approaches to improve causal inference is also important. Here it is the design of the study that addresses the problem of potential bias – either by ensuring it is not present (under certain assumptions) or by comparing results across methods with different sources and direction of potential bias. The distinction between statistical and design-based approaches is not an absolute one, but it provides a framework for triangulation – the thoughtful application of multiple approaches (e.g. statistical and design based), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and in particular sources and directions of bias. It is unlikely that any single method can provide a definite answer to a causal question, but the triangulation of evidence provided by different approaches can provide a stronger basis for causal inference. Triangulation can be considered part of wider efforts to improve the transparency and robustness of scientific research, and the wider scientific infrastructure and system of incentives.},

Two primary considerations are the form of the research question and the statistical tools best suited to address that question. Because the choice of statistical tools is not rigid, we make recommendations about when each tool may be most useful. Recent Findings: When dimensionality is relatively low, some statistical tools yield easily interpretable estimates of effect (e.g., risk ratio, odds ratio) or intervention impacts. When dimensionality increases, it is often necessary to compromise this interpretablity in favor of identifying interesting statistical signals from noise; this requires applying statistical tools that are oriented more heavily towards dimension reduction via shrinkage and/or variable selection. Summary: The study of complex exposure mixtures has prompted development of novel statistical methods. We suggest that further validation work would aid practicing researchers in choosing among existing and emerging statistical tools for studying exposure mixtures.},

  abstract = {Motivated by a study of surgical operating time and post-operative outcomes for lung cancer, we consider the estimation of causal effects of continuous point-exposure treatments. To investigate causality, the standard paradigm postulates a series of treatment-specific counterfactual outcomes and establishes conditions under which we may learn about them from observational study data. While many choices are possible, causal effects are typically defined in terms of variation of the mean of counterfactual outcomes in hypothetical worlds in which specific treatment strategies are ‘applied’ to all individuals. For example, one might compare two worlds: one where each individual receives some specific dose and a second where each individual receives some other dose. For our motivating study, defining causal effects in this way corresponds to (hypothetical) interventions that could not conceivably be implemented in the real world. In this work, we consider an alternative, complimentary framework that investigates variation in the mean of counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical treatment strategies where each individual receives a treatment dose corresponding to that actually received but modified in some pre-specified way. Quantification of this variation is defined in terms of contrasts for specific interventions as well as in terms of the parameters of a new class of marginal structural mean models. Within this framework, we propose three estimators: an outcome regression estimator, an inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator and a doubly robust estimator. We illustrate the methods with an analysis of the motivating data. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Reports show the associations between prenatal exposure to BP-3 and the risk of fetal loss, but its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Pregnant ICR mice were gavaged with BP-3 from gestational day (GD) 0 to GD 6 at doses of 0.1, 10 and 1000~mg/kg/day. The samples were collected on GD 12. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was used to detect metabolome changes in fetal mice, the uterus and the placenta to identify the underlying mechanism. The results showed that the body weight and relative organ weights of the liver, brain and uterus of pregnant mice were not significantly changed between the control group and the treatment group. BP-3 increased fetal loss, and induced placental thrombosis and tissue necrosis with enhancement of platelet aggregation. Metabolomic analysis revealed that fructose and mannose metabolism, the TCA cycle, arginine and proline metabolism in the fetus, arginine and proline metabolism and biotin metabolism in the uterus, and arginine biosynthesis and pyrimidine metabolism in the placenta were the key changed pathways involved in the above changes. Our study indicates that exposure to BP-3 can induce placental thrombosis and fetal loss via the disruption of maternal and fetal metabolism in mice, providing novel insights into the influence of BP-3 toxicity on the female reproductive system.},

  abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although diet and activity are key factors in the obesity epidemic, laboratory studies suggest that endocrine disrupting chemicals may also affect obesity. METHODS: We analyzed associations between six phthalate metabolites measured in urine and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants aged 6-80. We included 4369 participants from NHANES 1999-2002, with data on mono-ethyl (MEP), mono-2-ethylhexyl (MEHP), mono-n-butyl (MBP), and mono-benzyl (MBzP) phthalate; 2286 also had data on mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl (MEHHP) and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl (MEOHP) phthalate (2001-2002). Using multiple regression, we computed mean BMI and WC within phthalate quartiles in eight age/gender specific models. RESULTS: The most consistent associations were in males aged 20-59; BMI and WC increased across quartiles of MBzP (adjusted mean BMI = 26.7, 27.2, 28.4, 29.0, p-trend = 0.0002), and positive associations were also found for MEOHP, MEHHP, MEP, and MBP. In females, BMI and WC increased with MEP quartile in adolescent girls (adjusted mean BMI = 22.9, 23.8, 24.1, 24.7, p-trend = 0.03), and a similar but less strong pattern was seen in 20-59 year olds. In contrast, MEHP was inversely related to BMI in adolescent girls (adjusted mean BMI = 25.4, 23.8, 23.4, 22.9, p-trend = 0.02) and females aged 20-59 (adjusted mean BMI = 29.9, 29.9, 27.9, 27.6, p-trend = 0.02). There were no important associations among children, but several inverse associations among 60-80 year olds. CONCLUSION: This exploratory, cross-sectional analysis revealed a number of interesting associations with different phthalate metabolites and obesity outcomes, including notable differences by gender and age subgroups. Effects of endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, may depend upon endogenous hormone levels, which vary dramatically by age and gender. Individual phthalates also have different biologic and hormonal effects. Although our study has limitations, both of these factors could explain some of the variation in the observed associations. These preliminary data support the need for prospective studies in populations at risk for obesity.},

  abstract = {Background Harmonized data describing simultaneous exposure to a large number of environmental contaminants in-utero and during childhood is currently very limited. Objectives To characterize concentrations of a large number of environmental contaminants in pregnant women from Europe and their children, based on chemical analysis of biological samples from mother-child pairs. Methods We relied on the Early-Life Exposome project, HELIX, a collaborative project across six established population-based birth cohort studies in Europe. In 1301 subjects, biomarkers of exposure to 45 contaminants (i.e. organochlorine compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, toxic and essential elements, phthalate metabolites, environmental phenols, organophosphate pesticide metabolites and cotinine) were measured in biological samples from children (6–12\,years) and their mothers during pregnancy, using highly sensitive biomonitoring methods. Results Most of the exposure biomarkers had high detection frequencies in mothers (35 out of 45 biomarkers with {$>$}90\% detected) and children (33 out of 45 biomarkers with {$>$}90\% detected). Concentrations were significantly different between cohorts for all compounds, and were generally higher in maternal compared to children samples. For most of the persistent compounds the correlations between maternal and child concentrations were moderate to high (Spearman Rho\,{$>$}\,0.35), while for most non-persistent compounds correlations were considerably lower (Spearman Rho\,{$<$}\,0.15). For mercury, PFOS and PFOA a considerable proportion of the samples of both mothers and their children exceeded the HBM I value established by The Human Biomonitoring Commission of the German Federal Environment Agency. Discussion Although not based on a representative sample, our study suggests that children across Europe are exposed to a wide range of environmental contaminants in fetal life and childhood including many with potential adverse effects. For values exceeding the HBM I value identification of specific sources of exposure and reducing exposure in an adequate way is recommended. Considerable variability in this “chemical exposome” was seen between cohorts, showing that place of residence is a strong determinant of one's personal exposome. This extensive dataset comprising {$>$}100,000 concentrations of environmental contaminants in mother-child pairs forms a unique possibility for conducting epidemiological studies using an exposome approach.},

This includes human and animal data focusing on nutrition or environmental chemicals during development. However, the term DOHaD has not been generally accepted as the official term to be used when one is concerned with understanding the pathophysiological basis for how environmental influences acting during early development influence the risk of later noncommunicable diseases. Similarly, there is no global research or public health program built around the DOHaD paradigm that encompasses all aspects of environment. To better inform the global health efforts aimed at addressing the growing epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases of environmental origin, we propose a two-pronged approach: first, to make it clear that the current concept of DOHaD comprehensively includes a range of environmental factors and their relevance to disease occurrence not just throughout the life span but potentially across several generations; and second, to initiate the discussion of how adoption of DOHaD can promote a more realistic, accurate, and integrative approach to understanding environmental disruption of developmental programming and better inform clinical and policy interventions.

  abstract = {Continuous treatments have posed a significant challenge for causal inference, both in the formulation and identification of scientifically meaningful effects and in their robust estimation. Traditionally, focus has been placed on techniques applicable to binary or categorical treatments with few levels, allowing for the application of propensity score-based methodology with relative ease. Efforts to accommodate continuous treatments introduced the generalized propensity score, yet estimators of this nuisance parameter commonly utilize parametric regression strategies that sharply limit the robustness and efficiency of inverse probability weighted estimators of causal effect parameters. We formulate and investigate a novel, flexible estimator of the generalized propensity score based on a nonparametric function estimator that provably converges at a suitably fast rate to the target functional so as to facilitate statistical inference. With this estimator, we demonstrate the construction of nonparametric inverse probability weighted estimators of a class of causal effect estimands tailored to continuous treatments. To ensure the asymptotic efficiency of our proposed estimators, we outline several non-restrictive selection procedures for utilizing a sieve estimation framework to undersmooth estimators of the generalized propensity score. We provide the first characterization of such inverse probability weighted estimators achieving the nonparametric efficiency bound in a setting with continuous treatments, demonstrating this in numerical experiments. We further evaluate the higher-order efficiency of our proposed estimators by deriving and numerically examining the second-order remainder of the corresponding efficient influence function in the nonparametric model. Open source software implementing our proposed estimation techniques, the haldensify R package, is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the effects of occupational exposure to diisononyl phthalate (DINP) on serum testosterone levels in male workers. METHODS: From 2015 to 2018, 97 male workers were recruited from six French factories in the plastics industry. In a short longitudinal study, changes over 3 days in the level of total or free serum testosterone and DINP exposure were measured. DINP exposure was measured by urinary biomonitoring: mono-4-methyl-7-oxo-octyl phthalate (OXO-MINP), mono-4-methyl-7-hydroxy-octyl phthalate (OH-MINP) and mono-4-methyl-7-carboxyheptylphthalate (CX-MINP). We further analysed changes in follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, total testosterone to oestradiol ratio and two bone turnover markers (procollagen-type-I-N propeptide, C terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen), and erectile dysfunction via standardised questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Function, Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males). Linear mixed models were used with the variables 'age' and 'abdominal diameter' included as confounder. RESULTS: Increased urinary OXO-MINP was associated with a significant decrease in total serum testosterone concentrations, but only for workers who exhibited the smallest variations and lowest exposures (p=0.002). The same pattern was observed for CX-MINP but was not significant; no association with OH-MINP was detectable. More self-reported erectile problems were found in workers exposed directly to DINP at the workstation (p=0.01). No changes were observed for the other biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to DINP is associated with a decrease in total serum testosterone levels in male workers. Our results suggest that DINP could present weak antiandrogenic properties in humans, but these need to be confirmed by other studies.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What is the association between BMI and subfertility? SUMMARY ANSWER: We observed a J-shaped relationship between BMI and subfertility in both sexes, when using both a standard multivariable regression and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: High BMI in both women and men is associated with subfertility in observational studies and this relationship is further substantiated by a few small randomized controlled trials of weight reduction and success of assisted reproduction. Women with low BMI also have lower conception rates with assisted reproduction technologies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study (the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study), 28{$\mkern1mu$}341 women and 26{$\mkern1mu$}252 men, recruited from all over Norway between 1999 and 2008. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women (average age 30, average BMI 23.1\,kg/m2) and men (average age 33, average BMI 25.5\,kg/m2) had available genotype data and provided self-reported information on time-to-pregnancy and BMI. A total of 10\% of couples were subfertile (time-to-pregnancy ≥12\,months). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Our findings support a J-shaped association between BMI and subfertility in both sexes using multivariable logistic regression models. Non-linear MR validated this relationship. A 1\,kg/m2 greater genetically predicted BMI was linked to 18\% greater odds of subfertility (95\% CI 5\% to 31\%) in obese women (≥30.0\,kg/m2) and 15\% lower odds of subfertility (-24\% to -2\%) in women with BMI {$<$}20.0\,kg/m2. A 1\,kg/m2 higher genetically predicted BMI was linked to 26\% greater odds of subfertility (8-48\%) among obese men. Low genetically predicted BMI values were also related to greater subfertility risk in men at the lower end of the BMI distribution. A genetically predicted BMI of 23 and 25\,kg/m2 was linked to the lowest subfertility risk in women and men, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitations of our study were that we did not know whether the subfertility was driven by the women, men or both; the exclusive consideration of individuals of northern European ancestry; and the limited amount of participants with obesity or BMI values {$<$}20.0\,kg/m2. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results support a causal effect of obesity on subfertility in women and men. Our findings also expand the current evidence by indicating that individuals with BMI values {$<$}20\,kg/m2 may have an increased risk of subfertility. These results suggest that BMI values between 20 and 25\,kg/m2 are optimal for a minimal risk of subfertility.

  abstract = {Development of the mammalian central nervous system is a complex process whose disruption may have severe and long-lasting consequences upon brain structure and function, potentially resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Many NDDs are known to be genetic in origin, with symptom onset and their underlying mechanisms now known to be regulated during time-dependent windows or 'critical periods' during normal brain development. However, it is increasingly evident that similar disturbances to the developing nervous system may be caused by exposure to non-genetic, environmental factors. Strikingly, at least 200 industrially applied or produced chemicals have been associated with neurotoxicity in humans and exposure to these modifying compounds, through consumer products or environmental pollution, therefore poses serious threats to public health. Through a combination of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, we identified developmental periods for increased vulnerability to environmentally-modifying compounds and determined whether and how exposure during specific sensitive time-windows could increase the risk for the NDDs of autism, ADHD or schizophrenia in the developing organism. We report that many environmental toxicants have distinct sensitive time-windows during which exposure may disrupt critical developmental events, thereby increasing the risk of developing NDDs. The majority of these time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. We propose four underlying mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, altered neurotransmission and thyroid hormone disruption. Given the complexity of underlying mechanisms and their prenatal inception, treatment options are currently limited. Thus, we conclude that preventing early exposure to environmental toxicants, by increasing public awareness and improving government and industry guidelines, may ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of NDDs.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long struggled to identify causal effects in nonexperimental settings. Many recently proposed strategies assume ignorability of the treatment assignment mechanism and require fitting two models—one for the assignment mechanism and one for the response surface. This article proposes a strategy that instead focuses on very flexibly modeling just the response surface using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling procedure, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART has several advantages: it is far simpler to use than many recent competitors, requires less guesswork in model fitting, handles a large number of predictors, yields coherent uncertainty intervals, and fluidly handles continuous treatment variables and missing data for the outcome variable. BART also naturally identifies heterogeneous treatment effects. BART produces more accurate estimates of average treatment effects compared to propensity score matching, propensity-weighted estimators, and regression adjustment in the nonlinear simulation situations examined. Further, it is highly competitive in linear settings with the “correct” model, linear regression. Supplemental materials including code and data to replicate simulations and examples from the article as well as methods for population inference are available online.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of treatment effects and more general estimands is typically achieved via parametric modeling, which is unsatisfactory since model misspecification is likely. Data-adaptive model building (e.g., statistical/machine learning) is commonly employed to reduce the risk of misspecification. Naïve use of such methods, however, delivers estimators whose bias may shrink too slowly with sample size for inferential methods to perform well, including those based on the bootstrap. Bias arises because standard data-adaptive methods are tuned toward minimal prediction error as opposed to, for example, minimal MSE in the estimator. This may cause excess variability that is difficult to acknowledge, due to the complexity of such strategies. Building on results from nonparametric statistics, targeted learning and debiased machine learning overcome these problems by constructing estimators using the estimand’s efficient influence function under the nonparametric model. These increasingly popular methodologies typically assume that the efficient influence function is given, or that the reader is familiar with its derivation. In this article, we focus on derivation of the efficient influence function and explain how it may be used to construct statistical/machine-learning-based estimators. We discuss the requisite conditions for these estimators to perform well and use diverse examples to convey the broad applicability of the theory.},

  abstract = {This tutorial discusses a recently developed methodology for causal inference based on longitudinal modified treatment policies (LMTPs). LMTPs generalize many commonly used parameters for causal inference including average treatment effects, and facilitate the mathematical formalization, identification, and estimation of many novel parameters. LMTPs apply to a wide variety of exposures, including binary, multivariate, and continuous, as well as interventions that result in violations of the positivity assumption. LMTPs can accommodate time-varying treatments and confounders, competing risks, loss-to-follow-up, as well as survival, binary, or continuous outcomes. This tutorial aims to illustrate several practical uses of the LMTP framework, including describing different estimation strategies and their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. We provide numerous examples of types of research questions which can be answered within the proposed framework. We go into more depth with one of these examples -- specifically, estimating the effect of delaying intubation on critically ill COVID-19 patients' mortality. We demonstrate the use of the open source R package lmtp to estimate the effects, and we provide code on https://github.com/kathoffman/lmtp-tutorial.},

  abstract = {When presenting visualizations of experimental results, scientists often choose to display either inferential uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty in the estimate of a population mean) or outcome uncertainty (e.g., variation of outcomes around that mean) about their estimates. How does this choice impact readers’ beliefs about the size of treatment effects? We investigate this question in two experiments comparing 95\% confidence intervals (means and standard errors) to 95\% prediction intervals (means and standard deviations). The first experiment finds that participants are willing to pay more for and overestimate the effect of a treatment when shown confidence intervals relative to prediction intervals. The second experiment evaluates how alternative visualizations compare to standard visualizations for different effect sizes. We find that axis rescaling reduces error, but not as well as prediction intervals or animated hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), and that depicting inferential uncertainty causes participants to underestimate variability in individual outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures to phthalates, particularly high-molecular-weight (HMW) phthalates, are suspected to contribute to allergy. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether phthalate metabolites are associated with allergic symptoms and sensitization in a large nationally representative sample. METHODS: We used data on urinary phthalate metabolites and allergic symptoms (hay fever, rhinitis, allergy, wheeze, asthma) and sensitization from participants ≥ 6 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006. Allergen sensitization was defined as a positive response to at least one of 19 specific IgE antigens (≥ 0.35 kU/L). Odds ratios (ORs) per one log10 unit change in phthalate concentration were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age, race, body mass index, gender, creatinine, and cotinine. Separate analyses were conducted for children (6-17 years of age) and adults. RESULTS: The HMW phthalate metabolite monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was the only metabolite positively associated with current allergic symptoms in adults (wheeze, asthma, hay fever, and rhinitis). Mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate and the sum of diethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (both representing HMW phthalate exposures) were positively associated with allergic sensitization in adults. Conversely, in children, HMW phthalate metabolites were inversely associated with asthma and hay fever. Of the low-molecular-weight phthalate metabolites, monoethyl phthalate was inversely associated with allergic sensitization in adults (OR = 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.90). CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample, HMW phthalate metabolites, particularly MBzP, were positively associated with allergic symptoms and sensitization in adults, but there was no strong evidence for associations between phthalates and allergy in children 6-17 years of age.},

Non-targeted metabolomic profiling is an emerging method to identify biomarkers of the physiological response to such exposures. We investigated the effect of three commonly used ingredients in personal care products, diethyl phthalate (DEP), methylparaben (MPB) and triclosan (TCS), on the blood metabolome of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were treated with low levels of these chemicals comparable to human exposures during prepubertal and pubertal windows as well as chronically from birth to adulthood. Non-targeted metabolomic profiling revealed that most of the variation in the metabolites was associated with developmental stage. The low-dose exposure to DEP, MPB and TCS had a relatively small, but detectable impact on the metabolome. Multiple metabolites that were affected by chemical exposure belonged to the same biochemical pathways including phenol sulfonation and metabolism of pyruvate, lyso-plasmalogens, unsaturated fatty acids and serotonin. Changes in phenol sulfonation and pyruvate metabolism were most pronounced in rats exposed to DEP during the prepubertal period. Our metabolomics analysis demonstrates that human level exposure to personal care product ingredients has detectable effects on the rat metabolome. We highlight specific pathways such as sulfonation that warrant further study.},

  abstract = {Background Organophosphate pesticides act as cholinesterase inhibitors. For those with agricultural exposure to these chemicals, risk of potential exposure-related health effects may be modified by genetic variability in cholinesterase metabolism. Cholinesterase activity is a useful, indirect measurement of pesticide exposure, especially in high-risk individuals such as farmworkers. To understand fully the links between pesticide exposure and potential human disease, analyses must be able to consider genetic variability in pesticide metabolism. Objectives We studied participants in the Community Participatory Approach to Measuring Farmworker Pesticide Exposure (PACE3) study to determine whether cholinesterase levels are associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in pesticide metabolism. Methods Cholinesterase levels were measured from blood samples taken from 287 PACE3 participants at up to four time points during the 2007 growing season. We performed association tests of cholinesterase levels and 256 SNPs in 30 candidate genes potentially involved in pesticide metabolism. A false discovery rate (FDR) p-value was used to account for multiple testing. Results Thirty-five SNPs were associated (unadjusted p {$<$} 0.05) based on at least one of the genetic models tested (general, additive, dominant, and recessive). The strongest evidence of association with cholinesterase levels was observed with two SNPs, rs2668207 and rs2048493, in the butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene (FDR adjusted p = 0.15 for both; unadjusted p = 0.00098 and 0.00068, respectively). In participants with at least one minor allele, cholinesterase levels were lower by 4.3–9.5\% at all time points, consistent with an effect that is independent of pesticide exposure. Conclusions Common genetic variation in the BCHE gene may contribute to subtle changes in cholinesterase levels.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of TCS on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in gestational mice (G-mice) and nongestational female mice (Ng-mice) as a control. Herein, we show that the exposure of G-mice to TCS (8\,mg/kg) from gestational day (GD) 5 to GD17 significantly increased their levels of fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin, and insulin content in pancreatic β-cells with reduced homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β index and increased HOMA-IR index. Area under curve (AUC) of glucose and insulin tolerance tests in TCS (8\,mg/kg)-treated G-mice were markedly larger than controls. When compared with controls, TCS (8\,mg/kg)-treated G-mice showed a significant decrease in the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyroninelevels, PPARγ and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression, and Akt phosphorylation in adipose tissue and muscle. Replacement of L-thyroxine in TCS (8\,mg/kg)-treated G-mice corrected their insulin resistance and recovered the levels of insulin, PPARγ and GLUT4 expression, and Akt phosphorylation. Activation of PPARγ by administration of rosiglitazone recovered the decrease in Akt phosphorylation, but not GLUT4 expression. Although exposure to TCS (8\,mg/kg) in Ng-mice reduced thyroid hormones levels, it did not cause the insulin resistance or affect PPARγ and GLUT4 expression, and Akt phosphorylation. The findings indicate that the exposure of gestational mice to TCS (≥8\,mg/kg) results in insulin resistance via thyroid hormones reduction.},

  abstract = {Few studies have examined the association between environmental phthalate exposure and children’s neurocognitive development. This longitudinal study examined cognitive function in relation to pre-and postnatal phthalate exposure in children 2–12 years old. We recruited 430 pregnant women in their third trimester in Taichung, Taiwan from 2001–2002. A total of 110, 79, 76, and 73 children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, and 11, respectively. We evaluated the children’s cognitive function at four different time points using the Bayley and Wechsler tests for assessing neurocognitive functions and intelligence (IQ). Urine samples were collected from mothers during pregnancy and from children at each follow-up visit. They were analyzed for seven metabolite concentrations of widely used phthalate esters. These esters included monomethyl phthalate, monoethyl phthalate, mono-butyl phthalate, mono-benzyl phthalate, and three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, namely, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate. We constructed a linear mixed model to examine the relationships between the phthalate metabolite concentrations and the Bayley and IQ scores. We found significant inverse associations between the children’s levels of urinary mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate and the sum of the three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and their IQ scores (β = -1.818; 95\% CI: -3.061, -0.574, p = 0.004 for mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate; β = -1.575; 95\% CI: -3.037, -0.113, p = 0.035 for the sum of the three metabolites) after controlling for maternal phthalate levels and potential confounders. We did not observe significant associations between maternal phthalate exposure and the children’s IQ scores. Children’s but not prenatal phthalate exposure was associated with decreased cognitive development in the young children. Large-scale prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings in the future.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives: Mechanistic research suggests synergistic effects of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia pathologies on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting proteins relevant to shared mechanisms underlying CVD and dementia could also be used for the prevention of cognitive impairment.Methods: We applied Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalization analysis to investigate the causal relationships of 90 CVD-related proteins measured by the Olink CVD I panel with cognitive traits. Genetic instruments for circulatory protein concentrations were obtained using a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the SCALLOP consortium (N = 17,747) based on three sets of criteria: 1) protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL); 2) cis-pQTL (pQTL within ±500~kb from the coding gene); and 3) brain-specific cis-expression QTL (cis-eQTL) which accounts for coding gene expression based on GTEx8. Genetic associations of cognitive performance were obtained from GWAS for either: 1) general cognitive function constructed using Principal Component Analysis (N = 300,486); or, 2) g Factor constructed using genomic structural equation modelling (N = 11,263–331,679). Findings for candidate causal proteins were replicated using a separate protein GWAS in Icelanders (N = 35,559).Results: A higher concentration of genetically predicted circulatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) was nominally associated with better cognitive performance (p {$<$} 0.05) using different selection criteria for genetic instruments. Particularly, brain-specific cis-eQTL predicted MPO, which accounts for protein-coding gene expression in brain tissues, was associated with general cognitive function (βWald = 0.22, PWald = 2.4 × 10−4). The posterior probability for colocalization (PP.H4) of MPO pQTL with the g Factor was 0.577. Findings for MPO were replicated using the Icelandic GWAS. Although we did not find evidence for colocalization, we found that higher genetically predicted concentrations of cathepsin D and CD40 were associated with better cognitive performance and a higher genetically predicted concentration of CSF-1 was associated with poorer cognitive performance.Conclusion: We conclude that these proteins are involved in shared pathways between CVD and those for cognitive reserve or affecting cognitive decline, suggesting therapeutic targets able to reduce genetic risks conferred by cardiovascular disease.},

Hierarchical clustering revealed common and unique epigenetic-metabolic associations related to smoking. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that a joint metabolome-epigenome approach can reveal additional details in molecular responses to the environmental exposure to understand disease risk.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal data are necessary to reveal changes within an individual as he or she ages. However, rarely will a single cohort study capture data throughout a person’s entire life span. Here we describe in detail the steps needed to develop life-course trajectories from cohort studies that cover different and overlapping periods of life. Such independent studies are probably from heterogenous populations, which raises several challenges, including: 1) data harmonization (deriving new harmonized variables from differently measured variables by identifying common elements across all studies); 2) systematically missing data (variables not measured are missing for all participants in a cohort); and 3) model selection with differing age ranges and measurement schedules. We illustrate how to overcome these challenges using an example which examines the associations of parental education, sex, and race/ethnicity with children’s weight trajectories. Data were obtained from 5 prospective cohort studies (carried out in Belarus and 4 regions of the United Kingdom) spanning data collected from birth to early adulthood during differing calendar periods (1936–1964, 1972–1979, 1990–2012, 1996–2016, and 2007–2015). Key strengths of our approach include modeling of trajectories over wide age ranges, sharing of information across studies, and direct comparison of the same parts of the life course in different geographical regions and time periods. We also introduce a novel approach of imputing individual-level covariates of a multilevel model with a nonlinear growth trajectory and interactions.},

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship of preconception OP exposure with birth sizes among Chinese women undergoing IVF. METHODS: This study included 302 couples seeking infertility treatment in the China National Birth Cohort Study, from Shanghai, China, who gave birth to singleton infants between 2018 and 2021. Clinical data were collected from medical records. We measured the concentrations of six nonspecific dialkyl phosphates (DAP) metabolites of OPs [diethylthiophosphate (DETP), diethylphosphate (DEP), diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMTP), dimethylphosphate (DMP), and dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP)] in maternal urine. DMDTP and DEDTP were precluded from further analyses due to the low detection rates. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression analyses were performed to examine the individual and joint effects of OP exposures on gestational age, birth weight, body length, and ponderal index. Odder ratio (OR) of preterm birth were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Women in the highest as compared with lowest quartile of DEP had shorter gestational age (β~=~- 0.68; 95\% CI~=~-1.24, -0.11). The association was modified by sex, with boys showing larger decreases in gestational age (β~=~- 0.86; 95\% CI~=~-1.60, -0.13). No associations were found between other DAP metabolites and birth sizes. Results from linear models with individual DAP metabolites were corroborated by the WQS regression where DEP had the largest contribution to the overall mixture effect on gestational age (weight~=~0.70). Moreover, DEP concentration was associated with an elevated risk of preterm birth (OR~=~1.35, 95\% CI~=~1.11, 2.25). CONCLUSION: Preconception DEP concentration was associated with shortened gestational age and increased risk of preterm birth, and the association was more pronounced among boys than girls.},

Main outcome measures Scores in written language (Danish) and mathematics examinations as graded by masked assessors at the end of compulsory schooling (ninth grade, ages 15-16 years), in addition to intelligence test score at military conscription (predominantly at age 18 years) for a nested sub-cohort of male adolescents.

Results Among 792 724 full siblings in the cohort, 44 322 (5.6\%) were born before 37+0 weeks of gestation. After adjusting for multiple confounders (sex, birth weight, malformations, parental age at birth, parental educational level, and number of older siblings) and shared family factors between siblings, only children born at {$<$}34 gestational weeks showed reduced mean grades in written language (z score difference −0.10 (95\% confidence interval −0.20 to −0.01) for ≤27 gestational weeks) and mathematics (−0.05 (−0.08 to −0.01) for 32-33 gestational weeks, −0.13 (−0.17 to −0.09) for 28-31 gestational weeks, and −0.23 (−0.32 to −0.15) for ≤27 gestational weeks), compared with children born at 40 gestational weeks. In a nested sub-cohort of full brothers with intelligence test scores, those born at 32-33, 28-31, and ≤27 gestational weeks showed a reduction in IQ points of 2.4 (95\% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.6), 3.8 (2.3 to 5.3), and 4.2 (0.8 to 7.5), respectively, whereas children born at 34-39 gestational weeks showed a reduction in intelligence of {$<$}1 IQ point, compared with children born at 40 gestational weeks.

This study investigated the effect of pregnancy weight gain on fetal growth using a sibling comparison design to control for unmeasured confounding by genetic and shared environmental factors.         Methods:~         Our study population included 44,457 infants (21,680 women) with electronic medical records in the Stockholm–Gotland Obstetrical Database, 2008–2014. We standardized pregnancy weight gain into gestational age-specific z-scores. Fetal size was classified as birthweight (gram), and as small- and large-for-gestational-age birth (birthweight {$<$}10th or {$>$}90th percentiles, respectively). Our sibling comparison analyses used multivariable linear fixed effects models for birthweight and hybrid logistic fixed effects models for small- and large-for-gestational-age birth (SGA and LGA). We repeated analyses using conventional (unmatched) regression models.         Results:~         Sibling comparison analyses showed a clinically meaningful association between weight gain and fetal size (e.g., adjusted difference of +89\,g birthweight [95\% CI = 82, 95 g]; adjusted risk ratios [aRR] for SGA of 0.80 [95\% CI = 0.75, 0.86] per 1 z-score increase in weight gain for a woman of body mass index [BMI] = 25). These findings were consistent across the range of BMI. Estimates were only modestly attenuated compared with conventional approach (+97\,g [95\% CI = 92, 102 g], aRR for SGA of 0.70 [95\% CI = 0.67, 0.73] per 1 z-score increase in weight gain).         Conclusion:~         The positive association between pregnancy weight gain and fetal size we found using a sibling comparison design suggests that this relation has minimal confounding by familial factors that remain constant between pregnancies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal studies suggest that pesticide exposure elicits endocrine changes, increases embryo implantation failure, and decreases litter size. However, only a few epidemiological studies have evaluated the effects of pesticides on the outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancies. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the associations between preconception organophosphate pesticides (OP) exposure and pregnancy outcomes among women undergoing IVF in a Chinese population. METHODS: This study included 522 women with infertility who underwent IVF. Women were recruited from a prospective study, the China National Birth Cohort (CNBC), from Shanghai, China, between July 2017 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical information were collected from medical records and through questionnaires. Preconception exposure to OP was assessed by measuring six nonspecific dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites [diethylthiophosphate (DETP), diethylphosphate (DEP), diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP)] in urine samples collected at recruitment. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to evaluate the associations between OP and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with women in the lowest quartile (Q1) of individual DEP and Σ4DAP (the sum of DMP, DMTP, DEP, and DETP), women in the highest quartile (Q4) had lower odds of successful implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth, and most of the negative trends were significant (p-trends{$<$}0.05). There were no significant associations between urinary DAP concentrations and early IVF outcomes, including total and mature oocyte counts, best embryo quality, fertilization, E2 trigger levels, and endometrial wall thickness. CONCLUSION: Preconception OP exposure was inversely associated with successful implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth in women who underwent IVF. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7076.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Review how to use metabolomic profiling in causal mediation analysis to assess epidemiological evidence for air pollution impacts on birth outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Maternal exposures to air pollutants have been associated with pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Causal mediation analysis enables us to estimate direct and indirect effects on outcomes (i.e., effect decomposition), elucidating causal mechanisms or effect pathways. Maternal metabolites and metabolic pathways are perturbed by air pollution exposures may lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, thus they can be considered mediators in the causal pathways. Metabolomic markers have been used to explain the biological mechanisms linking air pollution and respiratory function, and of arsenic exposure and birth weight. However, mediation analysis of metabolomic markers has not been used to assess air pollution effects on adverse birth outcomes. In this article, we describe the assumptions and applications of mediation analysis using metabolomic markers that elucidate the potential mechanisms of the effects of air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation along specified pathways can be assessed within the structural causal modeling framework. For causal inferences, several assumptions that go beyond the data-including no uncontrolled confounding-need to be made to justify the effect decomposition. Nevertheless, studies that integrate metabolomic information in causal mediation analysis may greatly improve our understanding of the effects of ambient air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes as they allow us to suggest and test hypotheses about underlying biological mechanisms in studies of pregnant women.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies provide evidence that environmental exposures may affect health through complex mixtures. Formal investigation of the effect of exposure mixtures is usually achieved by modelling interactions, which relies on strong assumptions relating to the identity and the number of the exposures involved in such interactions, and on the order and parametric form of these interactions. These hypotheses become difficult to formulate and justify in an exposome context, where influential exposures are numerous and heterogeneous. To capture both the complexity of the exposome and its possibly pleiotropic effects, models handling multivariate predictors and responses, such as partial least squares (PLS) algorithms, can prove useful. As an illustrative example, we applied PLS models to data from a study investigating the inflammatory response (blood concentration of 13 immune markers) to the exposure to four disinfection by-products (one brominated and three chlorinated compounds), while swimming in a pool. To accommodate the multiple observations per participant (n=60; before and after the swim), we adopted a multilevel extension of PLS algorithms, including sparse PLS models shrinking loadings coefficients of unimportant predictors (exposures) and/or responses (protein levels). Despite the strong correlation among co-occurring exposures, our approach identified a subset of exposures (n=3/4) affecting the exhaled levels of 8 (out of 13) immune markers. PLS algorithms can easily scale to high-dimensional exposures and responses, and prove useful for exposome research to identify sparse sets of exposures jointly affecting a set of (selected) biological markers. Our descriptive work may guide these extensions for higher dimensional data.},

Bayesian CPMs inherit many of the benefits of frequentist CPMs and have advantages with regard to interpretation, flexibility, and exact inference (within simulation error) for parameters and functions of parameters. We explore characteristics of the Bayesian CPM through simulations and a case study using HIV biomarker data. In addition, we provide the package 'bayesCPM' which implements Bayesian CPM models using the R interface to the Stan probabilistic programing language. The Bayesian CPM for continuous outcomes can be implemented with only minor modifications to the prior specification and, despite some limitations, has generally good statistical performance with moderate or large sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Many research questions concern treatment effects on outcomes that can recur several times in the same individual. For example, medical researchers are interested in treatment effects on hospitalizations in heart failure patients and sports injuries in athletes. Competing events, such as death, complicate causal inference in studies of recurrent events because once a competing event occurs, an individual cannot have more recurrent events. Several statistical estimands have been studied in recurrent event settings, with and without competing events. However, the causal interpretations of these estimands, and the conditions that are required to identify these estimands from observed data, have yet to be formalized. Here we use a formal framework for causal inference to formulate several causal estimands in recurrent event settings, with and without competing events. When competing events exist, we clarify when commonly used classical statistical estimands can be interpreted as causal quantities from the causal mediation literature, such as (controlled) direct effects and total effects. Furthermore, we show that recent results on interventionist mediation estimands allow us to define new causal estimands with recurrent and competing events that may be of particular clinical relevance in many subject matter settings. We use causal directed acyclic graphs and single world intervention graphs to illustrate how to reason about identification conditions for the various causal estimands based on subject matter knowledge. Furthermore, using results on counting processes, we show that our causal estimands and their identification conditions, which are articulated in discrete time, converge to classical continuous time counterparts in the limit of fine discretizations of time. We propose estimators and establish their consistency for the various identifying functionals. Finally, we use the proposed estimators to compute the effect of blood pressure lowering treatment on the recurrence of acute kidney injury using data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.},

  abstract = {“Heterogeneous treatment effects” is a term which refers to conditional average treatment effects (i.e., CATEs) that vary across population subgroups. Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating such effects because they can help detect populations that may particularly benefit from or be harmed by a treatment. However, standard regression approaches for estimating heterogeneous effects are limited by preexisting hypotheses, test a single effect modifier at a time, and are subject to the multiple-comparisons problem. In this article, we aim to offer a practical guide to honest causal forests, an ensemble tree-based learning method which can discover as well as estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a data-driven approach. We discuss the fundamentals of tree-based methods, describe how honest causal forests can identify and estimate heterogeneous effects, and demonstrate an implementation of this method using simulated data. Our implementation highlights the steps required to simulate data sets, build honest causal forests, and assess model performance across a variety of simulation scenarios. Overall, this paper is intended for epidemiologists and other population health researchers who lack an extensive background in machine learning yet are interested in utilizing an emerging method for identifying and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.},

We studied associations between prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations of synthetic phenols and placental DNA methylation. Our study involved 202 mother-son pairs from the French EDEN cohort. Nine phenols were measured in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. We performed DNA methylation analysis of the fetal side of placental tissues using the IlluminaHM450 BeadChips. We evaluated methylation changes of individual CpGs in an adjusted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We performed mediation analysis to test whether placental tissue heterogeneity mediated the association between urinary phenol concentrations and DNA methylation. We identified 46 significant DMRs (≥5 CpGs) associated with triclosan (37 DMRs), 2,4-dichlorophenol (3), benzophenone-3 (3), methyl- (2) and propylparaben (1). All but 2 DMRs were positively associated with phenol concentrations. Out of the 46 identified DMRs, 7 (6 for triclosan) encompassed imprinted genes (APC, FOXG1, GNAS, GNASAS, MIR886, PEG10, SGCE), which represented a significant enrichment. Other identified DMRs encompassed genes encoding proteins responsible for cell signaling, transmembrane transport, cell adhesion, inflammatory, apoptotic and immunological response, genes encoding transcription factors, histones, tumor suppressors, genes involved in tumorigenesis and several cancer risk biomarkers. Mediation analysis suggested that placental cell heterogeneity may partly explain these associations. This is the first study describing the genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation associated with pregnancy exposure to synthetic phenols or their precursors. Our results suggest that cell heterogeneity might mediate the effects of triclosan exposure on placental DNA methylation. Additionally, the enrichment of imprinted genes within the DMRs suggests mechanisms by which certain exposures, mainly to triclosan, could affect fetal development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to phthalates during pregnancy may alter DNA methylation in the placenta, a crucial organ for the growth and development of the fetus. OBJECTIVES: We studied associations between urinary concentrations of phthalate biomarkers during pregnancy and placental DNA methylation. METHODS: We measured concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites in maternal spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks in 202 pregnant women. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in placental tissue (fetal side) collected at delivery. We first investigated changes in global DNA methylation of repetitive elements Alu and LINE-1. We then performed an adjusted epigenome-wide association study using IlluminaHM450 BeadChips and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with phthalate exposure. RESULTS: Monobenzyl phthalate concentration was inversely associated with placental methylation of Alu repeats. Moreover, all phthalate biomarkers except for monocarboxy-iso-octyl phthalate and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate were associated with at least one DMR. All but three DMRs showed increased DNA methylation with increased phthalate exposure. The largest identified DMR (22 CpGs) was positively associated with monocarboxy-iso-nonyl phthalate and encompassed heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, HSPA1L). The remaining DMRs encompassed transcription factors and nucleotide exchange factors, among other genes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation in association with pregnancy exposure to phthalates. Our results suggest epigenetic mechanisms by which exposure to these compounds could affect fetal development. Of interest, four identified DMRs had been previously associated with maternal smoking, which may suggest particular sensitivity of these genomic regions to the effect of environmental contaminants.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, studies suggest benefits of natural environments or greenness on children's health. However, little is known about cumulative exposure or windows of susceptibility to greenness exposure. Using inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models (IPW/MSM), we estimated effects of greenness exposure from birth through adolescence on executive function and behavior. We analyzed data of 908 children from Project Viva enrolled at birth in 1999-2002 and followed up until early adolescence. In mid-childhood (median 7.7 years) and early adolescence (13.1 years), executive function and behavior were assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Greenness was measured at birth, early childhood, mid-childhood, and early adolescence, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. We used inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models to estimate effects of interventions that ensure maximum greenness exposure versus minimum through all intervals; and that ensure maximum greenness only in early childhood (vs. minimum through all intervals). Results of the effects of "maximum (vs. minimum) greenness at all timepoints" did not suggest associations with mid-childhood outcomes. Estimates of "maximum greenness only in early childhood (vs. minimum)" suggested a beneficial association with mid-childhood SDQ (-3.21, 99~\%CI: -6.71,0.29 mother-rated; -4.02, 99~\%CI: -7.87,-0.17 teacher-rated). No associations were observed with early adolescent outcomes. Our results for "persistent" maximum greenness exposure on behavior, were not conclusive with confidence intervals containing the null. The results for maximum greenness "only in early childhood" may shed light on sensitive periods of greenness exposure for behavior regulation.},

  abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

To arrive at the conclusion that “IQ is strongly affected by genetic factors,” Bouchard and colleagues omitted their control group reared-apart dizygotic twin (DZA) IQ score correlations. Near-full-sample correlations published after the study’s 2000 end point show that the reared-apart monozygotic twin (MZA) and DZA group IQ correlations did not differ at a statistically significant level, suggesting that the study failed the first step in determining that IQ scores are influenced by heredity. After bypassing the model-fitting technique they used in most non-IQ MISTRA studies, the researchers assumed that the MZA group IQ score correlation alone “directly estimates heritability.” This method was based on unsupported assumptions by the researchers, and they largely overlooked the confounding influence of cohort effects. Bouchard and colleagues then decided to count most environmental influences they did recognize as genetic influences. I conclude that the MISTRA IQ study failed to discover genetic influences on IQ scores and cognitive ability across the studied population, and that the study should be evaluated in the context of psychology’s replication problem.},

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism underlying OP effects on the adult 5-HT system. First, acute in~vivo administration of the OP diazinon (0, 1.3, 13 or 39~mg/kg i.p.) to male Hooded Lister rats inhibited the activity of the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase in blood and in the hippocampus, dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), striatum and prefrontal cortex. Diazinon-induced cholinesterase inhibition was greatest in the DRN, the brain's major source of 5-HT neurones. Second, acute in~vivo diazinon exposure (0 or 39~mg/kg i.p.) increased the basal firing rate of DRN neurones measured ex~vivo in brain slices. The excitatory responses of DRN neurones to α1-adrenoceptor or AMPA/kainate receptor activation were not affected by in~vivo diazinon exposure but the inhibitory response to 5-HT was attenuated, indicating 5-HT1A autoreceptor down-regulation. Finally, direct application of the diazinon metabolite diazinon oxon to naive rat brain slices increased the firing rate of DRN 5-HT neurones, as did chlorpyrifos-oxon, indicating the effect was not unique to diazinon. The oxon-induced augmentation of firing was blocked by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist mecamylamine and the AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor antagonist DNQX. Together these data indicate that 1) acute OP exposure inhibits DRN cholinesterase, leading to acetylcholine accumulation, 2) the acetylcholine activates nicotinic receptors on 5-HT neurones and also on glutamatergic neurones, thus releasing glutamate and activating 5-HT neuronal AMPA/kainate receptors 3) the increase in 5-HT neuronal activity, and resulting 5-HT release, may lead to 5-HT1A autoreceptor down-regulation. This mechanism may be involved in the reported increase in risk of developing anxiety and depression following occupational OP exposure.},

  abstract = {Parabens are widely used preservatives present in consumer products like cosmetics and food. Although several epidemiological studies suggest that early-life exposure to parabens might alter the immune response and allergy risk in childhood, the evidence with respect to asthma is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of paraben exposure on asthma development in mice and humans. Using a murine asthma model the experimental data show both, an asthma-reducing effect after direct exposure of adult mice to n-butyl paraben (nBuP) as well as an asthma-promoting effect after maternal exposure to ethyl paraben (EtP) in the female offspring. Interestingly, exposure of mice to a mixture of EtP and nBuP starting prenatally until the end of asthma induction in the adult offspring was without effect on allergic airway inflammation. In addition, parabens were determined within the German prospective mother-child cohort LINA and their single and mixture effect on asthma development in children within the first 10~years of life was estimated by logistic and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Both approaches revealed no adverse effects of parabens on children's asthma development, neither when stratified for being at risk due to a positive family history of atopy nor when analysed separately for sex specificity. Therefore, we conclude that although single parabens might differentially impact asthma development, an adverse effect could not be seen in a multiple paraben exposure setting. Consequently, not only the time point of exposure but also multiple exposure scenarios to parabens should be considered in the evaluation of individuals' specific disease risk.},

A large number of chemicals have been identified as endocrine disruptors and humans can be exposed to them either due to their occupations or through dietary and environmental exposure (water, soil and air). Endocrine disrupting chemicals are compounds that alter the normal functioning of the endocrine system of both humans and wildlife. In order to understand the vulnerability and risk factors of people due to endocrine disruptors as well as the remedies for these, methods need to be developed in order to predict effects on populations and communities from the knowledge of effects on individuals. For several years there have been a growing interest on the mechanism and effect of endocrine disruptors and their relation with environment and human health effect. This paper, based on extensive literature survey, briefly studies the progress mainly in human to provide information concerning causative substances, mechanism of action, ubiquity of effects and important issues related to endocrine disruptors. It also reviews the current knowledge of the potential impacts of endocrine disruptors on human health so that the effects can be known and remedies applied for the problem as soon as possible.},

  abstract = {Most reported treatment effects in medical research studies are ambiguously defined, which can lead to misinterpretation of study results. This is because most authors do not attempt to describe what the treatment effect represents, and instead require readers to deduce this based on the reported statistical methods. However, this approach is challenging, because many methods provide counterintuitive results. For example, some methods include data from all patients, yet the resulting treatment effect applies only to a subset of patients, whereas other methods will exclude certain patients while results will apply to everyone. Additionally, some analyses provide estimates pertaining to hypothetical settings in which patients never die or discontinue treatment. Herein we introduce estimands as a solution to the aforementioned problem. An estimand is a clear description of what the treatment effect represents, thus saving readers the necessity of trying to infer this from study methods and potentially getting it wrong. We provide examples of how estimands can remove ambiguity from reported treatment effects and describe their current use in practice. The crux of our argument is that readers should not have to infer what investigators are estimating; they should be told explicitly.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effect of the environment on human health has benefited from progress made in measuring the exposome. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has made it possible to measure small molecules across a large dynamic range, allowing researchers to study the role of low abundance environmental toxicants in causing human disease. HRMS data have a high dimensional structure (number of predictors {$>$} number of observations), generating information on the abundance of many chemical features (predictors) which may be highly correlated. Unsupervised dimension reduction techniques can allow dimensionality reduction of the various features into components that capture the essence of the variability in the exposome dataset. We illustrate and discuss the relevance of three different unsupervised dimension reduction techniques: principal component analysis, factor analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization. We focus on the utility of each method in understanding the relationship between the exposome and a disease outcome and describe their strengths and limitations. While the utility of these methods is context specific, it remains important to focus on the interpretability of results from each method.},

  abstract = {Background: Phthalate is a chemical that is commonly used as a plasticizer in processing plastic products and as a solvent in personal care products. Although previous experimental studies have reported that phthalate metabolites are associated with obesity, epidemiological study results have been inconsistent and insufficient. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between urinary phthalate metabolites and obesity in adult Korean population. Methods: The present study selected 4,752 Korean adults aged 19 years or older from the 2012-2014 Korean National Environmental Health Survey data. The concentrations of urinary di-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites-i.e., mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate-mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were adjusted using the urinary creatinine. We used logistic regression analysis to investigate the association between urinary phthalate metabolite concentration and body mass index (BMI) with respect to sex and age. Results: Among women, urinary MEHHP and DEHP concentrations were found to have statistically significantly positive associations with obesity (Q4 versus Q1; odds ratio (OR): 1.72, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-2.49 for MEHHP and OR: 1.52, 95\% CI: 1.04-2.21 for DEHP). Among men, urinary MnBP concentration was found to have statistically significantly negative association with obesity (Q4 versus Q1; OR: 0.71, 95\% CI: 0.50-0.99). In the analysis stratified by sex and age, women aged ≥ 50 years showed statistically significantly positive associations between the concentrations of urinary DEHP metabolites, DEHP, MBzP, and obesity (Q4 versus Q1; OR: 1.94, 95\% CI: 1.28-2.94 for MEHHP, OR: 1.88, 95\% CI: 1.21-2.94 for MEOHP, OR: 2.04, 95\% CI: 1.31-3.18 for DEHP, and Q3 versus Q1; OR: 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.02-2.05 for MBzP). Meanwhile, men aged ≥ 50 years showed no significant associations between urinary phthalate concentrations and obesity. Conclusions: In the present study, we found differences in the associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and BMI according to sex and age. However, because the present study was cross-sectional in nature, additional support through prospective studies is needed to estimate the causal associations.},

  abstract = {Social epidemiology seeks to describe and quantify the causal effects of social institutions, interactions, and structures on human health. To accomplish this task, we define exposures as treatments and posit populations exposed or unexposed to these well-defined regimens. This inferential structure allows us to unambiguously estimate and interpret quantitative causal parameters and to investigate how these may be affected by biases such as confounding. This paradigm has been challenged recently by some critics who favor broadening the exposures that may be studied beyond treatments to also consider states. Defining the exposure protocol of an observational study is a continuum of specificity, and one may choose to loosen this definition, incurring the cost of causal parameters that become commensurately more vague. The advantages and disadvantages of broader versus narrower definitions of exposure are matters of continuing debate in social epidemiology as in other branches of epidemiology.},

  abstract = {We thank Dr. Zigler for writing an insightful commentary (1) that nicely summarizes appealing aspects of our work and offers helpful criticism. We had raised many of the points ourselves in our article (2) and appreciate the opportunity to more fully address others.We used a Bayesian approach to estimate a joint effect of airborne metals exposure on infant birth weight that reflects a useful public health question: Would decommissioning coal-fired power plants improve birth outcomes? Dr. Zigler’s main concern about our primary estimand relates to the necessity for model extrapolation below our exposure range, where “validity is almost entirely dependent upon the adequacy of the statistical model” (1, p. 2659). This concern is appropriate and reflects broader tradeoffs with exposure mixtures between what is useful and what is answerable. With the sensitivity to model specification in mind, our primary analysis utilized a series of first-order product terms to approximate a nonlinear/nonadditive model while using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA was appealing for allowing uncertainty in model form as well as for the well-studied utility of model averaging in extrapolation-based forecasting (3). We additionally addressed a study question examining hypothetical percentile-based interventions on ambient levels of all 6 metals. Because this question did not necessitate extrapolation for inference, this strategy explicitly addressed Dr. Zigler’s query about how Bayesian g-computation “would fare in settings with fewer data limitations” (1, p. 2660). We also used numerous sensitivity analyses to study sensitivity to priors, and we used simulations to better understand the conditions necessary for our approach to yield favorable bias-variance tradeoffs. Nonetheless, as we stated, “accuracy outside the range of the data is untestable in the data set at hand” (2, p. 2655); hence, we agreed with Dr. Zigler when we wrote that specification “bias is unknown in our coal plant example” (2, p. 2653).},

  abstract = {Most work in causal inference considers deterministic interventions that set each unit’s treatment to some fixed value. However, under positivity violations these interventions can lead to nonidentification, inefficiency, and effects with little practical relevance. Further, corresponding effects in longitudinal studies are highly sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, resulting in widespread use of unrealistic parametric models. We propose a novel solution to these problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values rather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have several crucial advantages. First, they avoid positivity assumptions entirely. Second, they require no parametric assumptions and yet still admit a simple characterization of longitudinal effects, independent of the number of timepoints. For example, they allow longitudinal effects to be visualized with a single curve instead of lists of coefficients. After characterizing incremental interventions and giving identifying conditions for corresponding effects, we also develop general efficiency theory, propose efficient nonparametric estimators that can attain fast convergence rates even when incorporating flexible machine learning, and propose a bootstrap-based confidence band and simultaneous test of no treatment effect. Finally, we explore finite-sample performance via simulation, and apply the methods to study time-varying sociological effects of incarceration on entry into marriage.

In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic technique from robust statistics — to trace a model’s prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visuallyindistinguishable training-set attacks.},

A longitudinal birth cohort was established to investigate pesticide exposures from different agricultural activities. Maternal urinary organophosphate metabolites were measured at 28 weeks of pregnancy (n=86), delivery (n=67) and 2 months postpartum (n=51). METHOD: Subjects were interviewed with questionnaires about work, home and behavioral factors potentially associated with pesticide exposures, and spot urine samples were also collected. The urine samples were analyzed for dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP) and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP), using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The urinary DMP and dialkyl phosphate (DAP) concentrations at 28 weeks of pregnancy and delivery were not significantly different, but the DMP and DAP concentrations at 28 weeks of pregnancy and DAP concentrations at delivery were significantly different (p{$<$}0.05) from those at 2 months postpartum. The factors influencing the urinary DAP concentrations at 28 weeks of pregnancy included insecticide used in the home, living close to agricultural farmland, frequency of agricultural field visits during the first and second trimesters of pregnancies, occupation of subjects, pesticide used and other agricultural activities. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary organophosphate metabolites, DMP, DEP, DETP, DEDTP, total DEP and DAPs, at 28 weeks of pregnancy, delivery and 2 months postpartum fluctuated depending on their pesticide exposures both at home and in agricultural fields.},

  abstract = {Phthalates are multifunctional chemicals that are used in a variety of consumer products including cosmetic and personal care products. This study aims at determining phthalate levels in cosmetic and personal care products obtained from the Canadian market. Overall 252 products including 98 baby care products were collected at retail stores in several provinces across Canada in year 2007. These products included fragrances, hair care products (hair sprays, mousses, and gels), deodorants (including antiperspirants), nail polishes, lotions (body lotions and body creams), skin cleansers, and baby products (oils, lotions, shampoos and diaper creams). Samples were extracted with different organic solvents, depending on the types of the products, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Of the 18 investigated phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected. The detection frequencies were in the following order: DEP (103 out of 252 products){$>$}DnBP (15/252){$>$}DiBP (9/252){$>$}DEHP (8/252){$>$}DMP (1/252). DEP was detected in almost all types of surveyed products with the highest levels (25,542μg/g, equal to 2.6\%) found in fragrances. DnBP was largely present in nail polish products with the highest concentration of 24,304μg/g (2.4\%). DnBP was also found in other products such as hair sprays, hair mousses, skin cleansers and baby shampoos at much lower concentrations (36μg/g and less). Levels of other detected phthalates were generally low in the products. Based on these values, daily dermal exposure dosage to five phthalates was estimated for three age groups, female adults (60kg); toddlers (0.5–4 years) and infants (0–6 months), through the use of cosmetic and personal care products. The exposure estimation, however, was based on existing products use pattern data, instead of probabilistic model based population use distribution. For female adults, the maximal daily exposure of 78μg/kgbw/d was determined for DEP. The maximal daily exposure was much lower for the other four phthalates (DEHP, 0.82μg/kgbw/d; DnBP, 0.36μg/kgbw/d; and DMP, 0.03μg/kgbw/d). The exposure for DiBP was not calculated due to its very low levels ({$<$}10μg/g) in products. Toddlers and infants in this case had a maximal daily exposure to DEP of 20 and 42μg/kgbw/d, respectively.},

This article focuses on the different imputation techniques available in the package. Four different imputation methods are currently implemented in VIM, namely hot-deck imputation, k-nearest neighbor imputation, regression imputation and iterative robust model-based imputation (Templ, Kowarik, and Filzmoser 2011). All of these methods are implemented in a flexible manner with many options for customization. Furthermore in this article practical examples are provided to highlight the use of the implemented methods on real-world applications. In addition, the graphical user interface of VIM has been re-implemented from scratch resulting in the package VIMGUI (Schopfhauser, Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) to enable users without extensive R skills to access these imputation and visualization methods.},

We tested the hypotheses that: 1) High SES in childhood, young adulthood, midlife, and late life have independent causal effects on higher cognition level and slower cognitive decline; 2) Compared with stable low SES (referent), stable high SES has the largest estimated effect for higher cognition level and slower decline among life-course SES combinations. The Rush Memory and Aging Project enrolled 1,940 dementia-free older adults in northeastern Illinois (1997–2018). We used inverse probability–weighted marginal structural models to estimate the joint and independent effect of each life-course SES on global and domain-specific cognition. A total of 1,746 participants had, on average, 6 years of follow-up. High SES at each life-course stage starting in young adulthood had a protective estimated effect on global and domain-specific cognition intercepts. Compared with consistently low SES, consistently high SES (β~= 0.64, 95\% confidence interval: 0.48, 0.93) and high SES beyond childhood (β~= 0.64, 95\% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.83) had the largest benefit for global cognition intercepts. None of the life-course SES measures influenced rate of global or domain-specific decline. Additional understanding of life-course SES components influencing cognitive level is warranted.},

  abstract = {The exponential growth of pollutant discharges into the environment due to increasing industrial and agricultural activities is a rising threat for human health and a biggest concern for environmental health globally. Several synthetic chemicals, categorized as potential environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are evident to affect the health of not only livestock and wildlife but also humankind. In recent years, human exposure to environmental EDCs has received increased awareness due to their association with altered human health as documented by several epidemiological and experimental studies. EDCs are associated with deleterious effects on male and female reproductive health; causes diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, thyroid homeostasis and increase the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. Sewage effluents are a major source of several EDCs, which eventually reach large water bodies and potentially contaminate the drinking water supply. Similarly, water storage material such as different types of plastics also leaches out EDCs in drinking Water. Domestic wastewater containing pharmaceutical ingredients, metals, pesticides and personal care product additives also influences endocrine activity. These EDCs act via various receptors through a variety of known and unknown mechanisms including epigenetic modification. They differ from classic toxins in several ways such as low-dose effect, non-monotonic dose and trans-generational effects. This review aims to highlight the hidden burden of EDCs on human health and discusses the non-classical toxic properties of EDCs in an attempt to understand the magnitude of the exposome on human health. Present data on the environmental EDCs advocate that there may be associations between human exposure to EDCs and several undesirable health outcomes that warrants further human bio-monitoring of EDCs.},

  abstract = {Negative control variables are increasingly used to adjust for unmeasured confounding bias in causal inference using observational data. They are typically identified by subject matter knowledge and there is currently a severe lack of data-driven methods to find negative controls. In this paper, we present a statistical test for discovering negative controls of a special type -- disconnected negative controls -- that can serve as surrogates of the unmeasured confounder, and we incorporate that test into the Data-driven Automated Negative Control Estimation (DANCE) algorithm. DANCE first uses the new validation test to identify subsets of a set of candidate negative control variables that satisfy the assumptions of disconnected negative controls. It then applies a negative control method to each pair of these validated negative control variables, and aggregates the output to produce an unbiased point estimate and confidence interval for a causal effect in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We (1) prove the correctness of this validation test, and thus of DANCE; (2) demonstrate via simulation experiments that DANCE outperforms both naive analysis ignoring unmeasured confounding and negative control method with randomly selected candidate negative controls; and (3) demonstrate the effectiveness of DANCE on a challenging real-world problem.},

A complex literature of mechanistic studies provides evidence on the hazards of EDC exposure, yet there is no widely accepted systematic method to integrate these data to help identify EDC hazards. Inspired by work to improve hazard identification of carcinogens using key characteristics (KCs), we have developed ten KCs of EDCs based on our knowledge of hormone actions and EDC effects. In this Expert Consensus Statement, we describe the logic by which these KCs are identified and the assays that could be used to assess several of these KCs. We reflect on how these ten KCs can be used to identify, organize and utilize mechanistic data when evaluating chemicals as EDCs, and we use diethylstilbestrol, bisphenol A and perchlorate as examples to illustrate this approach.},

  abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease (AD), the two most common neurodegenerative disorders in American adults, are of purely genetic origin in a minority of cases and appear in most instances to arise through interactions among genetic and environmental factors. In this article we hypothesize that environmental exposures in early life may be of particular etiologic importance and review evidence for the early environmental origins of neurodegeneration. For PD the first recognized environmental cause, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), was identified in epidemiologic studies of drug abusers. Chemicals experimentally linked to PD include the insecticide rotenone and the herbicides paraquat and maneb; interaction has been observed between paraquat and maneb. In epidemiologic studies, manganese has been linked to parkinsonism. In dementia, lead is associated with increased risk in chronically exposed workers. Exposures of children in early life to lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, and methylmercury have been followed by persistent decrements in intelligence that may presage dementia. To discover new environmental causes of AD and PD, and to characterize relevant gene–environment interactions, we recommend that a large, prospective genetic and epidemiologic study be undertaken that will follow thousands of children from conception (or before) to old age. Additional approaches to etiologic discovery include establishing incidence registries for AD and PD, conducting targeted investigations in high-risk populations, and improving testing of the potential neurologic toxicity of chemicals.},

BMI and spot urinary triclosan levels were obtained from adults. Using two different exposure measures-either presence vs. absence or quartiles of triclosan-we assessed the association between triclosan and BMI. We also screened all NHANES serum and urine biomarkers to identify correlated factors that might confound observed associations. RESULTS: Compared with undetectable triclosan, a detectable level was associated with a 0.9-point increase in BMI (p{$<$}0.001). In analysis by quartile, compared to the lowest quartile, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles of urinary triclosan were associated with BMI increases of 1.5 (p{$<$}0.001), 1.0 (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.002), and 0.3 (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.33) respectively. The one strong correlate of triclosan identified in NHANES was its metabolite, 2,4-dichlorophenol (ρ{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.4); its association with BMI, however, was weaker than that of triclosan. No other likely confounder was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan exposure is associated with increased BMI. Stronger effect at moderate than high levels suggests a complex mechanism of action.},

  abstract = {Quantitative bias analysis serves several objectives in epidemiological research. First, it provides a quantitative estimate of the direction, magnitude and uncertainty arising from systematic errors. Second, the acts of identifying sources of systematic error, writing down models to quantify them, assigning values to the bias parameters and interpreting the results combat the human tendency towards overconfidence in research results, syntheses and critiques and the inferences that rest upon them. Finally, by suggesting aspects that dominate uncertainty in a particular research result or topic area, bias analysis can guide efficient allocation of sparse research resources.The fundamental methods of bias analyses have been known for decades, and there have been calls for more widespread use for nearly as long. There was a time when some believed that bias analyses were rarely undertaken because the methods were not widely known and because automated computing tools were not readily available to implement the methods. These shortcomings have been largely resolved. We must, therefore, contemplate other barriers to implementation. One possibility is that practitioners avoid the analyses because they lack confidence in the practice of bias analysis.The purpose of this paper is therefore to describe what we view as good practices for applying quantitative bias analysis to epidemiological data, directed towards those familiar with the methods. We focus on answering questions often posed to those of us who advocate incorporation of bias analysis methods into teaching and research. These include the following. When is bias analysis practical and productive? How does one select the biases that ought to be addressed? How does one select a method to model biases? How does one assign values to the parameters of a bias model? How does one present and interpret a bias analysis?.We hope that our guide to good practices for conducting and presenting bias analyses will encourage more widespread use of bias analysis to estimate the potential magnitude and direction of biases, as well as the uncertainty in estimates potentially influenced by the biases.},

  abstract = {A goal of many research programmes in biology is to extract meaningful insights from large, complex datasets. Researchers in ecology, evolution and behavior (EEB) often grapple with long-term, observational datasets from which they construct models to test causal hypotheses about biological processes. Similarly, epidemiologists analyse large, complex observational datasets to understand the distribution and determinants of human health. A key difference in the analytical workflows for these two distinct areas of biology is the delineation of data analysis tasks and explicit use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), widely adopted by epidemiologists. Here, we review the most recent causal inference literature and describe an analytical workflow that has direct applications for EEB. We start this commentary by defining four distinct analytical tasks (description, prediction, association, causal inference). The remainder of the text is dedicated to causal inference, specifically focusing on the use of DAGs to inform the modelling strategy. Given the increasing interest in causal inference and misperceptions regarding this task, we seek to facilitate an exchange of ideas between disciplinary silos and provide an analytical framework that is particularly relevant for making causal inference from observational data.},

In the present study, the differential expression in the schizophrenic subjects was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. The limited homology to proteins of known function and lack of functional domains in the encoded protein have made it difficult to predict a function for KIAA0513. We used in situ hybridization, RNA blots, western blots, and immunocytochemistry to examine KIAA0513 expression in normal brain and peripheral tissues. The gene is ubiquitously expressed but is enriched in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum. Finally, interacting proteins were identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen to functionally characterize the protein. KIAA0513 interacts with KIBRA, HAX-1, and INTS4, which also interact with proteins involved in neuroplasticity, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal regulation. Therefore, KIAA0513 is likely to be involved in signaling pathways related to these processes.},

Here, I discuss the last 15\,years of epidemiological research published by BMC Medicine, with a specific focus on how this reflects changes occurring in the field of epidemiology over this period; the impact of ‘Big Data’; the reinvigoration of debates about causality; and, as we increasingly work across and with many diverse disciplines, the use of the name ‘population health science’. Reviewing all publications from the first volume to the end of 2018, I show that most BMC Medicine papers are epidemiological in nature, and~the majority of them are applied epidemiology, with few methodological papers. Good research must address important translational questions that should not be driven by the increasing availability of data, but should take appropriate advantage of it. Over the next 15\,years it would be good to see more publications that integrate results from~several different methods, each with different sources of bias,~in a triangulation framework.},

  abstract = {Observational epidemiological studies suffer from many potential biases, from confounding and from reverse causation, and this limits their ability to robustly identify causal associations. Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’, and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with IV methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.

In this study, we have examined the early life determinants of childhood intelligence in a population-based birth cohort of individuals born in Brisbane, Australia between 1981 and 1984. In univariable analyses, family income in the year of birth, maternal and paternal education, maternal age at birth, maternal ethnicity, maternal smoking during pregnancy, duration of labour, birthweight, breast feeding and childhood height, and body mass index were all associated with intelligence at age 14. In multivariable analyses, the strongest and most robust predictors of intelligence were family income, parental education and breast feeding, with these three variables explaining 7.5\% of the variation in intelligence at age 14. Addition of other variables added little further explanatory power. Our results demonstrate the importance of indicators of socio-economic position as predictors of intelligence, and illustrate the need to consider the role of such factors in generating the association of childhood intelligence with adult disease risk.},

  abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

The role of environmental phenols and parabens in racial difference in metabolic disease burden has been suggested, but there is limited evidence. We examined the cross-sectional associations of urinary phenols and parabens with adipokines and effect modification by race. Urinary concentrations of 6 phenols (bisphenol-A, bisphenol-F, 2,4-diclorophenol, 2,5-diclorophenol, triclosan, benzophenone-3) and 4 parabens (methyl-paraben, ethyl-paraben, propyl-paraben, butyl-paraben) were measured in 2002–2003 among 1200 women (mean age~=~52.6) enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Multi-Pollutant Study. Serum adipokines included adiponectin, high molecular weight (HMW)-adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R). Linear regression models were used to estimate the adjusted percentage change in adipokines per inter-quantile range (IQR) increase in standardized and log-transformed levels of individual urinary phenols and parabens. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used to evaluate the joint effect of urinary phenols and parabens as mixtures. Participants included white (52.5\%), black (19.3\%), and Asian (28.1\%) women. Urinary 2,4-dichlorophenol was associated with 6.02\% (95\% CI: 1.20\%, 10.83\%) higher HMW-adiponectin and urinary bisphenol-F was associated with 2.60\% (0.48\%, 4.71\%) higher sOB-R. Urinary methyl-paraben was associated with lower leptin in all women but this association differed by race: 8.58\% (−13.99\%, −3.18\%) lower leptin in white women but 11.68\% (3.52\%, 19.84\%) higher leptin in black women (P interaction~=~0.001). No significant associations were observed in Asian women. Additionally, we observed a significant positive overall effect of urinary phenols and parabens mixtures in relation to leptin levels in black, but not in white or Asian women. Urinary bisphenol-F, 2,4-dichlorophenol and methyl-paraben may be associated with favorable profiles of adipokines, but methyl-paraben, widely used in hair and personal care products, was associated with unfavorable leptin levels in black women. Future studies are needed to confirm this racial difference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates are common industrial chemicals that are used as plasticizers in plastics, personal care products, and building materials. Although these chemicals have been suspected as risk factors for allergic outcomes among children, inconsistent associations between environmental exposure to phthalates and allergic disorders have been found across different populations. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether environmental phthalate exposure was associated with parent-reported current allergic symptoms (atopic dermatitis, AD; asthma; and allergic rhinitis, AR) and the index of allergic response (levels of serum total immunoglobulin E, IgE) in a nationally representative sample of children. METHODS: In this study, children aged 3-17 years (n~=~2208) were recruited from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) 2015-2017 to conduct an analysis of their current allergic symptoms. Among this number of children, the total IgE analysis included 806 participants because total IgE levels were only measured in children aged 12-17 years. RESULTS: After adjusting for all covariates, mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.15 (1.01, 1.30)], mono-(carboxyoctyl) phthalate (MCOP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.35 (1.02, 1.78)], and the sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.39 (1.09, 1.79)] were associated with increased odds of current AD. MCOP [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.19 (1.01, 1.40)], mono-(carboxynonyl) phthalate (MCNP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.24 (1.05, 1.45)], and ∑DEHP [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.22 (1.02, 1.44)] were also associated with increased odds of current AR. Individual DEHP metabolites showed similar associations with current AD and AR. In addition, MCNP was positively related to IgE levels [β (95\% CI)~=~0.26 (0.12, 0.40)]. MBzP [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.17 (1.01, 1.35)], MCOP [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.62 (1.12, 2.32)], and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.36 (1.06, 1.76)] showed positive relationships with allergic multimorbidity. Moreover, higher concentrations of MCNP were related to increased odds of experiencing both current AR and total IgE levels [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.98 (1.29, 3.04)], and children with elevated IgE levels ({$>$}100IU/mL) were more likely to have current AR associated with MCNP than those without elevated IgE levels (p~=~0.007). Specifically, the relationship between MCNP and current AR was significantly mediated through alterations in IgE levels (14.7\%), and MCNP also showed the positive association with current AR, independent of IgE (85.3\%). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that environmental exposure to phthalates may affect the immune system and increase the occurrence of allergic symptoms in children.},

In this study, we recruited the adult population (n~=~3782) of the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) 2015-2017 (Cycle 3) and assessed the associations between urinary biomarkers of phthalate, BPA, and paraben exposure with obesity and DM. A potential collider issue with the use of urinary creatinine (Cr) or specific gravity (SG) exists when adjusting urinary dilution; therefore, a covariate-adjusted standardization (CAS) was employed for adjustment, and the results were compared. In the present population, the direction of the association often varied depending on the choices made to adjust urinary dilution. When using CAS, the direction of association resembled those of previously reported experimental observations. With Cr or SG adjustment, ORs for obesity decreased in the highest quartiles of monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~Cr: 0.71 (0.54, 0.93); SG: 0.68 (0.52, 0.90)], monocarboxy-isononyl phthalate (MCNP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~Cr: 0.67 (0.52, 0.87); SG: 0.68 (0.52, 0.89)], and mono(3-carboxylpropyl) phthalate (MCPP) in the urine [OR (95\% CI)~=~Cr: 0.60 (0.47, 0.76); SG: 0.61 (0.48, 0.77)]; however, with CAS, these negative associations disappeared. Instead, mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.31 (1.03, 1.66)], BPA [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.62 (1.27, 2.06)], or ethyl paraben (EtP) [OR (95\% CI)~=~1.51 (1.19, 1.91)] concentrations in the highest quartile showed positive associations with a higher risk of obesity. On the other hand, for DM, an overall decrease in ORs was observed for phthalate metabolites and BPA following SG adjustment and disappeared with CAS adjustment. In addition, the highest quartiles of BPA, methyl paraben (MeP), and ethyl paraben (EtP) showed a significantly higher risk of DM than those in the lowest quartiles following CAS [OR (95\% CI)~=~BPA: 1.65 (1.06, 2.59); MeP: 1.68 (1.08, 2.60); and EtP: 2.74 (1.77, 4.24), respectively]. The present observations outline the importance of using an appropriate adjustment method for urinary dilution in association studies on obesity and DM. In addition, several phthalates, BPA, and parabens were identified as potential chemical risk factors for these outcomes. Further studies are warranted in other populations to confirm these observations.},

  abstract = {The plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and its hydrolysate mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) are major toxicants from plastics, but their association with hormone-dependent cancers has been controversial. We treated the human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and A2780 with low concentrations of DEHP/MEHP, and found that although no significant effect on cell proliferation was observed, ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were promoted by submicromolar MEHP but not DEHP. Next, ovarian cancer patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were obtained and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) supported enrichment and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, which identified PI3K/Akt pathway as a pivotal signaling pathway in ovarian cancer. We found that 500 nM MEHP treatment significantly increased PIK3CA expression, which could be reversed by the knockdown of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Silencing PIK3CA significantly suppressed the MEHP-induced migration, invasion and EMT. In addition, we validated that MEHP treatment promoted phosphorylation of Akt and degradation of IκB-α, thereby activating NF-κB and enhancing NF-κB nuclear translocation. In nude mice, MEHP exposure significantly promoted the metastasis of ovarian cancer xenografts, which could be suppressed by the treatment of PPARα inhibitor GW6471. Our findings showed that low-dose MEHP promoted ovarian cancer progression through activating PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, in a PPARα-dependent manner.},

  abstract = {Ambient air pollutants are well-known risk factors for childhood asthma and asthma exacerbation. It is unknown whether different air pollutants individually or jointly affect pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma. In this study, we aim to integrate transcriptome and untargeted metabolome to identify dysregulated genetic and metabolic pathways that are associated with exposures to a mixture of ambient and traffic-related air pollutants among adults with asthma history. In this cross-sectional study, 102 young adults with childhood asthma history were enrolled from southern California in 2012. Whole blood transcriptome was measured with 20,869 expression signatures, and serum untargeted metabolomics including 937 metabolites were analyzed by Metabolon, Inc. Participants’ exposures to regional air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5) and near-roadway air pollutants averaged at one month and one year before study visit were estimated based on residential addresses. xMWAS network analysis and joint-pathway analysis were performed to identify subnetworks and genetic and metabolic pathways that were associated with exposure to air pollutants adjusted for socio-characteristic covariates. Network analysis found that exposures to air pollutants mixture were connected to 357 gene markers and 92 metabolites. One-year and one-month averaged PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with several amino acids related to serine, glycine, and beta-alanine metabolism. Lower serum levels of carnosine and aspartate, which are involved in the beta-alanine metabolic pathway, as well as choline were also associated with worse asthma control (p~{$<~$}0.05). One-year and one-month averaged PM10 and one-month averaged O3 were associated with higher gene expression levels of HSPA5, LGMN, CTSL and HLA-DPB1, which are involved in antigen processing and presentation. These results indicate that exposures to various air pollutants are associated with altered genetic and metabolic pathways that affect anti-oxidative capacity and immune response and can potentially contribute to asthma-related pathophysiology.},

The concept of “exposome” leads to an intellectual framework of measuring many exposures in humans, and the emerging metabolomics technology offers a means to read out both the biological activity and environmental impact in the same dataset. How to integrate exposome and metabolome in data analysis is still challenging. Here, we employ a hierarchical community network to investigate the global associations between the metabolome and mixed exposures including DDTs, PFASs and PCBs, in a women cohort with sera collected in California in the 1960s. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the metabolite communities associated with the exposures were non-specific and shared among exposures. This suggests that a small number of metabolic phenotypes may account for the response to a large class of environmental chemicals.},

In this article, we illustrate use of the negative control exposure (NCE) approach to evaluate uncontrolled confounding bias in observational studies on pregnancy drug safety and explain the causal assumptions behind the method. We conducted an NCE analysis and evaluated the associations between maternal acetaminophen use during different exposure periods and ADHD among 8,856 children born in 1993–2005 to women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort. Information on regular maternal acetaminophen use was collected prospectively in biennial questionnaires. A total of 721 children (8.1\%) in the cohort had been diagnosed with ADHD as reported by the mothers. Our NCE analysis suggested that only acetaminophen use at the time of pregnancy was associated with childhood ADHD (odds ratio = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.72), and the effect estimates for the 2 NCE periods (about 4 years before and 4 years after the pregnancy) were null. Our findings corroborate those of prior reports suggesting that prenatal acetaminophen exposure may influence neurodevelopment. The lack of an association between acetaminophen use in the pre- and postpregnancy exposure periods and ADHD provides assurance that uncontrolled time-invariant factors do not explain this association.},

Since CHD is an atherosclerotic disease, we investigated if circulating levels of BPA and phthalate metabolites are related to atherosclerosis in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: In the population-based Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (1016 subjects all aged 70), the prevalence of overt plaques and echogenectity (grey scale median, GSM) of carotid artery plaques were recorded by ultrasound in both of the carotid arteries. The thickness (IMT) and echogenicity (IM-GSM) of the intima-media complex were also measured. Bisphenol A (BPA) and 10 phthalate metabolites were analyzed in serum by a API 4000 liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) was related to carotid plaques in an inverted U-shaped manner. This pattern was significant after adjustment for gender, body mass index, blood glucose, blood pressure, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, serum triglycerides, smoking, antihypertensive treatment and statin use (p=0.004). High levels of BPA, mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) and MMP were associated with an echogenic IM-GSM and plaque GSM, while high levels of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) were associated with an echolucent IM-GSM and plaque GSM (p{$<$}0.0001 after adjustment). CONCLUSION: The phthalate metabolite MMP was related to atherosclerotic plaques in an inverted U-shaped manner independently of CV risk factors. Some phthalates and BPA were also related to the echogenicity of the plaques, suggesting a role for plaque-associated chemicals in atherosclerosis.},

We evaluated if circulating concentrations of phthalates were related to different indices of obesity using data from the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study. Data from both dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used. METHODS: 1,016 subjects aged 70 years were investigated in the PIVUS study. Four phthalate metabolites were detected in the serum of almost all subjects ({$>$} 96\%) by an API 4000 liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometer. Abdominal MRI was performed in a representative subsample of 287 subjects (28\%), and a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-scan was obtained in 890 (88\%) of the subjects two year following the phthalate measurements. RESULTS: In women, circulating concentrations of mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were positively related to waist circumference, total fat mass and trunk fat mass by DXA, as well as to subcutaneous adipose tissue by MRI following adjustment for serum cholesterol and triglycerides, education, smoking and exercise habits (all p {$<$} 0.008). Mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) concentrations were related to trunk fat mass and the trunk/leg-ratio by DXA, but less powerful than MiBP. However, no such statistically significant relationships were seen in men. CONCLUSIONS: The present evaluation shows that especially the phthalate metabolite MiBP was related to increased fat amount in the subcutaneous abdominal region in women measured by DXA and MRI two years later.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials are commonly regarded as the gold standard for causal inference and play a pivotal role in modern evidence-based medicine. However, the sample sizes they use are often too limited to draw significant causal conclusions for subgroups that are less prevalent in the population. In contrast, observational data are becoming increasingly accessible in large volumes but can be subject to bias as a result of hidden confounding. Given these complementary features, we propose a power likelihood approach to augmenting RCTs with observational data for robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects. We provide a data-adaptive procedure for maximizing the Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD) to select the influence factor that best regulates the information from the observational data. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate the efficacy of our method and its favourable features compared to existing approaches. Lastly, we apply the proposed method to data from Tennessee's Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Study to demonstrate its usefulness and practicality in real-world data analysis.},

  abstract = {Exposure to environmental mixtures can exert wide-ranging effects on child neurodevelopment. However, there is a lack of statistical methods that can accommodate the complex exposure-response relationship between mixtures and neurodevelopment while simultaneously estimating neurodevelopmental trajectories. We introduce Bayesian varying coefficient kernel machine regression (BVCKMR), a hierarchical model that estimates how mixture exposures at a given time point are associated with health outcome trajectories. The BVCKMR flexibly captures the exposure-response relationship, incorporates prior knowledge, and accounts for potentially nonlinear and nonadditive effects of individual exposures. This model assesses the directionality and relative importance of a mixture component on health outcome trajectories and predicts health effects for unobserved exposure profiles. Using contour plots and cross-sectional plots, BVCKMR also provides information about interactions between complex mixture components. The BVCKMR is applied to a subset of data from PROGRESS, a prospective birth cohort study in Mexico city on exposure to metal mixtures and temporal changes in neurodevelopment. The mixture include metals such as manganese, arsenic, cobalt, chromium, cesium, copper, lead, cadmium, and antimony. Results from a subset of Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors data provide evidence of significant positive associations between second trimester exposure to copper and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development cognition score at 24 months, and cognitive trajectories across 6–24 months. We also detect an interaction effect between second trimester copper and lead exposures for cognition at 24 months. In summary, BVCKMR provides a framework for estimating neurodevelopmental trajectories associated with exposure to complex mixtures.},

  abstract = {Many diseases commonly associated with aging are now thought to have social and physiologic antecedents in early life. Understanding how the timing of exposure to early life risk factors influences later-life health may illuminate mechanisms driving adult health inequalities and identify possible points for effective interventions. Recognizing chronic diseases as developing across the lifecourse also has implications for the conduct of research on adult risk factors for disease. We review alternative conceptual models that describe how the timing of risk factor exposure relates to the development of disease. We propose some expansions of lifecourse models to improve their relevance for research on adult chronic disease, using the relationship between education and adult cognitive decline and dementia as an example. We discuss the important implications each of the lifecourse conceptual models has on study design, analysis, and interpretation of research on aging and chronic diseases. We summarize several research considerations implied by the lifecourse framework, including: advantages of analyzing change in function rather than onset of impairment; the pervasive challenge of survivor bias; the importance of controlling for possible confounding by early life conditions; and the likely heterogeneity in responses of adults to treatment.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pharmacoepidemiologists are often interested in estimating the effects of dynamic treatment strategies, where treatments are modified based on patients' evolving characteristics. For such problems, appropriate control of both baseline and time-varying confounders is critical. Conventional methods that control confounding by including time-varying treatments and confounders in an outcome regression model may not have a causal interpretation, even when all baseline and time-varying confounders are measured. This problem occurs when time-varying confounders are, themselves, affected by past treatment. We review alternative analytic approaches that can produce valid inferences in the presence of such confounding. We focus on the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models, two examples of Robins' g-methods. RECENT FINDINGS: Unlike standard outcome regression methods, the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models can estimate the effects of dynamic treatment strategies and appropriately control for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment. Few applications of g-methods exist in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, primarily due to the common use of administrative claims data, which typically lack detailed measurements of time-varying information, and the limited availability of or familiarity with tools to help perform the relatively complex analysis. These barriers may be overcome with the increasing availability of data sources containing more detailed time-varying information and more accessible learning tools and software. SUMMARY: With appropriate data and study design, g-methods can improve our ability to make causal inferences on dynamic treatment strategies from observational data in pharmacoepidemiology.},

In this study, we develop EWAS Atlas (http://bigd.big.ac.cn/ewas), a curated knowledgebase of EWAS that provides a comprehensive collection of EWAS knowledge. Unlike extant data-oriented epigenetic resources, EWAS Atlas features manual curation of EWAS knowledge from extensive publications. In the current implementation, EWAS Atlas focuses on DNA methylation-one of the key epigenetic marks; it integrates a large number of 329 172 high-quality EWAS associations, involving 112 tissues/cell lines and covering 305 traits, 1830 cohorts and 390 ontology entities, which are completely based on manual curation from 649 studies reported in 401 publications. In addition, it is equipped with a powerful trait enrichment analysis tool, which is capable of profiling trait-trait and trait-epigenome relationships. Future developments include regular curation of recent EWAS publications, incorporation of more epigenetic marks and possible integration of EWAS with GWAS. Collectively, EWAS Atlas is dedicated to the curation, integration and standardization of EWAS knowledge and has the great potential to help researchers dissect molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modifications associated with biological traits.},

  abstract = {Background Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in the epidemic of metabolic diseases. Epigenetic alterations may functionally link EDCs with gene expression and metabolic traits. Objectives We aimed to evaluate metabolic-related effects of the exposure to endocrine disruptors including five parabens, three bisphenols, and 13 metabolites of nine phthalates as measured in 24-hour urine on epigenome-wide DNA methylation. Methods A blood-based epigenome-wide association study was performed in 622 participants from the Lifelines DEEP cohort using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 methylation data and EDC excretions in 24-hour urine. Out of the 21 EDCs, 13 compounds were detected in {$>$}75\% of the samples and, together with bisphenol F, were included in these analyses. Furthermore, we explored the putative function of identified methylation markers and their correlations with metabolic traits. Results We found 20 differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) associated with 10 EDCs at suggestive p-value~{$<~$}1~×~10−6, of which four, associated with MEHP and MEHHP, were genome-wide significant (Bonferroni-corrected p-value~{$<~$}1.19~×~10−7). Nine out of 20 CpGs were significantly associated with at least one of the tested metabolic traits, such as fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, blood lipids, and/or blood pressure. 18 out of 20 EDC-associated CpGs were annotated to genes functionally related to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and glycemic traits. Conclusions The identified DNA methylation markers for exposure to the most common EDCs provide suggestive mechanism underlying the contributions of EDCs to metabolic health. Follow-up studies are needed to unravel the causality of EDC-induced methylation changes in metabolic alterations.},

  abstract = {When estimating the average effect of a binary treatment (or exposure) on an outcome, methods that incorporate propensity scores, the G-formula, or targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) are preferred over naïve regression approaches, which are biased under misspecification of a parametric outcome model. In contrast propensity score methods require the correct specification of an exposure model. Double-robust methods only require correct specification of either the outcome or the exposure model. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation is a semiparametric double-robust method that improves the chances of correct model specification by allowing for flexible estimation using (nonparametric) machine-learning methods. It therefore requires weaker assumptions than its competitors. We provide a step-by-step guided implementation of TMLE and illustrate it in a realistic scenario based on cancer epidemiology where assumptions about correct model specification and positivity (ie, when a study participant had 0 probability of receiving the treatment) are nearly violated. This article provides a concise and reproducible educational introduction to TMLE for a binary outcome and exposure. The reader should gain sufficient understanding of TMLE from this introductory tutorial to be able to apply the method in practice. Extensive R-code is provided in easy-to-read boxes throughout the article for replicability. Stata users will find a testing implementation of TMLE and additional material in the Appendix S1 and at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/migariane/SIM-TMLE-tutorial},

We explored associations between exposures and metabolism through an exposome-metabolome wide association scan and multivariate O2PLS modeling. Novel and reproducible associations were found across two periods of pregnancy for three nonpersistent pollutants and across two subcohorts for four of the persistent pollutants. We found novel metabolic signatures associated with arsenic exposure: TMAO and dimethylamine possibly related to gut microbial methylamine metabolism and homarine related to fish intake. Tobacco smoke exposure was related to coffee metabolism and PCBs with 3-hydroxyvaleric acid, usually released under ketoacidosis. These findings will have implications for further understanding of maternal-fetal health, and health across the life-course.},

Nonetheless, a number of methods have been developed to improve our ability to make valid causal inferences from data arising from observational studies. In this paper, I review concepts of causation as a background to counterfactual causal ideas; the latter ideas are central to much of current causal theory. Confounding greatly constrains causal inferences in all observational studies. Confounding is a biased measure of effect that results when one or more variables, that are both antecedent to the exposure and associated with the outcome, are differentially distributed between the exposed and non-exposed groups. Historically, the most common approach to control confounding has been multivariable modeling; however, the limitations of this approach are discussed. My suggestions for improving causal inferences include asking better questions (relates to counterfactual ideas and "thought" trials); improving study design through the use of forward projection; and using propensity scores to identify potential confounders and enhance exchangeability, prior to seeing the outcome data. If time-dependent confounders are present (as they are in many longitudinal studies), more-advanced methods such as marginal structural models need to be implemented.

To date, numerous studies have detailed the manner by which DNA methylation is influenced by the environment, resulting in altered global and gene-specific DNA methylation. These studies have focused on prenatal, early-life, and adult exposure scenarios. The present review summarizes currently available literature that demonstrates a relationship between DNA methylation and environmental exposures. It includes studies on aflatoxin B1, air pollution, arsenic, bisphenol A, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, persistent organic pollutants, tobacco smoke, and nutritional factors. It also addresses gaps in the literature and future directions for research. These gaps include studies of mixtures, sexual dimorphisms with respect to environmentally associated methylation changes, tissue specificity, and temporal stability of the methylation marks.},

  abstract = {An important goal of environmental health research is to assess the risk posed by mixtures of environmental exposures. Two popular classes of models for mixtures analyses are response-surface methods and exposure-index methods. Response-surface methods estimate high-dimensional surfaces and are thus highly flexible but difficult to interpret. In contrast, exposure-index methods decompose coefficients from a linear model into an overall mixture effect and individual index weights; these models yield easily interpretable effect estimates and efficient inferences when model assumptions hold, but, like most parsimonious models, incur bias when these assumptions do not hold. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian multiple index model framework that combines the strengths of each, allowing for non-linear and non-additive relationships between exposure indices and a health outcome, while reducing the dimensionality of the exposure vector and estimating index weights with variable selection. This framework contains response-surface and exposure-index models as special cases, thereby unifying the two analysis strategies. This unification increases the range of models possible for analysing environmental mixtures and health, allowing one to select an appropriate analysis from a spectrum of models varying in flexibility and interpretability. In an analysis of the association between telomere length and 18 organic pollutants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the proposed approach fits the data as well as more complex response-surface methods and yields more interpretable results.},

When using observational data, estimating those effects requires adjustment for confounding. However, conventional regression methods cannot appropriately adjust for confounding in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback. In contrast, estimators derived from Robins's g-formula may correctly adjust for confounding even if treatment-confounder feedback exists. The package gfoRmula implements in R one such estimator: the parametric g-formula. This estimator can be used to estimate the effects of binary or continuous time-varying treatments as well as contrasts defined by static or dynamic, deterministic, or random interventions, as well as interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment. The package accommodates survival outcomes as well as binary or continuous outcomes measured at the end of follow-up.

Almost all OP pesticides are metabolized to at least one of six possible dialkylphosphates (DAPs). Despite wide use, their potential effects on human reproductive health have not yet been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between urinary concentrations of six DAP metabolites and reproductive parameters in men. All men were attended an infertility clinic and provided urine, serum and semen samples on the same day. Six DAP metabolites were measured in urine (dimethylphosphate [DMP], dimethylthiophosphate [DMTP], dimethyldithiophosphate [DMDTP], diethylphosphate [DEP], diethylthiophosphate [DETP], and diethyldithiophosphate [DEDTP]). Sperm quality was assessed by measuring volume, concentration, total sperm count (TSC), motility and morphology, and serum samples were analyzed for reproductive hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, prolactin and estradiol. Pearson correlations were used for unadjusted analyses, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed controlling for appropriate covariates. All men presented detectable concentrations of at least one urinary OP metabolite. After adjustment by important covariates, there was a significant positive association between DEDTP concentrations and LH [(β)=11.4; 95\% CI 0.81-22.1] as well as FSH levels [(β)=3.2; 95\% CI 0.08-6.2]. Sperm concentration and TSC were both significantly inversely associated with DMP, DMDP, DMDTP and ∑DAP in multivariate analysis. Besides, there was a significant inverse association between percentage of motile sperm and DMTP, DMDTP and DEP metabolite concentrations. Our results suggest that exposure to OP pesticides may be associated with decreased sperm counts and motility and altered reproductive hormone levels in male partners of couples seeking for infertility treatment. However, further studies are warranted to confirm and extent these findings.},

This accumulation hypothesis is usually tested by summing indicators of binary variables across the life span to form an overall score that is then used as the exposure in regression models for health outcomes. This article highlights potential issues in the interpretation of results obtained from such an approach.Methods We propose a model-building framework that can be used to formally compare alternative hypotheses on the effect of multiple binary exposure measurements collected across the life course. The saturated model where the order and value of the binary variable at each time point influence the outcome of interest is compared with nested alternative specifications corresponding to the critical period, cumulative risk or hypotheses about the effect of changes in environment. This framework is illustrated with data on adult body mass index and socioeconomic position measured once in childhood and twice in adulthood from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, using a series of liner regression models.Results We demonstrate how analyses that only consider the association of a cumulative score with a later outcome may produce misleading results.Conclusion We recommend comparing a set of nested models—each corresponding to the accumulation, critical period and effect modification hypotheses—to an all-inclusive (saturated) model. This approach can provide a formal and clearer understanding of the relative merits of these alternative hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Standard regression analyses are often plagued with problems encountered when one tries to make inference going beyond main effects using data sets that contain dozens of variables that are potentially correlated. This situation arises, for example, in epidemiology where surveys or study questionnaires consisting of a large number of questions yield a potentially unwieldy set of interrelated data from which teasing out the effect of multiple covariates is difficult. We propose a method that addresses these problems for categorical covariates by using, as its basic unit of inference, a profile formed from a sequence of covariate values. These covariate profiles are clustered into groups and associated via a regression model to a relevant outcome. The Bayesian clustering aspect of the proposed modeling framework has a number of advantages over traditional clustering approaches in that it allows the number of groups to vary, uncovers subgroups and examines their association with an outcome of interest, and fits the model as a unit, allowing an individual's outcome potentially to influence cluster membership. The method is demonstrated with an analysis of survey data obtained from the National Survey of Children's Health. The approach has been implemented using the standard Bayesian modeling software, WinBUGS, with code provided in the supplementary material available at Biostatistics online. Further, interpretation of partitions of the data is helped by a number of postprocessing tools that we have developed.},

Using an approach based on the generalised propensity score (GPS) ? a generalisation of the classical, binary treatment propensity score ? it is possible to construct a balancing score that provides an estimation procedure for the true (unconfounded) direct effect of dose on response. Previously, the GPS has been applied only in a single interval setting; in this article, we extend the GPS methodology to the longitudinal setting to estimate the direct effect of a continuous dose on a longitudinal response. The methodology is applied to two simulated examples, and a real longitudinal dose?response investigation, the Monitored Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (MOTAS). In the treatment of childhood amblyopia, a common ophthalmological condition, occlusion therapy (patching) was for many decades the standard medical treatment, despite the fact that its efficacy was not quantified. MOTAS was revolutionary, as it was the first study to obtain precise measurements of the amount of occlusion each study participant received over the course of the study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have found associations between multiple aspects of social adversity and obesity in childhood, yet this research has largely been limited to cross-sectional data. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to address this limitation by using life course trajectory methods to determine whether multiple aspects of social adversity in early childhood are associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) throughout childhood. METHODS: Associations between multiple measures of social adversity from birth to 4 years and subsequent BMI trajectories to age 17 were examined in 7021 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. RESULTS: Higher BMI throughout ages 12-17 were observed for children whose parents had separated, were exposed to frequent residential mobility or who experienced moderate or great household financial difficulty in early childhood. After adjustment for confounding variables, associations were attenuated but remained for both moderate (two moves) and high (≥3 moves) residential mobility (mean \% difference in BMI at age 17 for children experiencing moderate and high residential mobility before age 4 compared with those experiencing no moves: 2.3; 95\% CI: 0.5-4.2; P\,=\,0.015 and 4.2; 95\% CI: 1.4-7.0; P\,=\,0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Associations between BMI and social adversity in childhood are present but largely explained by background socioeconomic position. However, there remain small but important differences between the BMI of children who are exposed to frequent residential mobility in early childhood after adjustment for socioeconomic and other confounders.},

  abstract = {Background Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasingly believed to originate from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current reviews exploring the neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an inadequate proxy. Objective We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood. Search strategy Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published after 1970. Selection criteria The analysis included studies that identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years of age. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted for cognitive, behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were summarised separately for children born at {$<$}35 and ≥35 weeks gestation. Main results Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR children born ≥35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born {$<$}35 weeks of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone. Conclusions IUGR increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected. Tweetable abstract IUGR is associated with an overall risk for neurodevelopmental delay in a range of neurodevelopmental domains.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND~AND OBJECTIVE: Education might be causal to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We triangulated cohort and genetic evidence to consolidate the causality between education and T2DM. METHODS: We obtained observational evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Self-reporting educational attainment was categorised as high (post-secondary and higher), middle (secondary), and low (below secondary or no academic qualifications) in 6,786 community-dwelling individuals aged\,≥\,50~years without diabetes at ELSA wave 2, who were followed until wave 8 for the first diabetes diagnosis. Additionally, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) using an inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and weighted mode-based estimate (WMBE) method. Steiger filtering was further applied to exclude single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were correlated with an outcome (T2DM) stronger than exposure (education attainment). RESULTS: We observed 598 new diabetes cases after 10.4~years of follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratios (95\% CI) of T2DM were 1.20 (0.97-1.49) and 1.58 (1.28-1.96) in the middle- and low-education groups, respectively, compared to the high-education group. Low education was also associated with increased glycated haemoglobin levels. Psychosocial resources, occupation, and health behaviours fully explained these inverse associations. In the MR analysis of 210 SNPs (R2\,=\,0.0161), the odds ratio of having T2DM per standard deviation-decreasing years (4.2~years) of schooling was 1.33 (1.01-1.75; IVW), 1.23 (0.37-4.17; MR-Egger), 1.56 (1.09-2.27; WM), and 2.94 (0.98-9.09; WMBE). However, applying Steiger filtering attenuated most MR results towards the null. CONCLUSIONS: Our inconsistent findings between cohort and genetic evidence did not support the causality between education and T2DM.},

  abstract = {Observational data are increasingly used with the aim of estimating causal effects of treatments, through careful control for confounding. Marginal structural models estimated using inverse probability weighting (MSMs-IPW), like other methods to control for confounding, assume that confounding variables are measured without error. The average treatment effect in an MSM-IPW may however be biased when a confounding variable is error prone. Using the potential outcome framework, we derive expressions for the bias due to confounder misclassification in analyses that aim to estimate the average treatment effect using an marginal structural model estimated using inverse probability weighting (MSM-IPW). We compare this bias with the bias due to confounder misclassification in analyses based on a conditional regression model. Focus is on a point-treatment study with a continuous outcome. Compared with bias in the average treatment effect in a conditional model, the bias in an MSM-IPW can be different in magnitude but is equal in sign. Also, we use a simulation study to investigate the finite sample performance of MSM-IPW and conditional models when a confounding variable is misclassified. Simulation results indicate that confidence intervals of the treatment effect obtained from MSM-IPW are generally wider, and coverage of the true treatment effect is higher compared with a conditional model, ranging from overcoverage if there is no confounder misclassification to undercoverage when there is confounder misclassification. Further, we illustrate in a study of blood pressure-lowering therapy, how the bias expressions can be used to inform a quantitative bias analysis to study the impact of confounder misclassification, supported by an online tool.},

  abstract = {Unlike parametric regression, machine learning (ML) methods do not generally require precise knowledge of the true data-generating mechanisms. As such, numerous authors have advocated for ML methods to estimate causal effects. Unfortunately, ML algorithms can perform worse than parametric regression. We demonstrate the performance of ML-based singly and doubly robust estimators. We used 100 Monte Carlo samples with sample sizes of 200, 1,200, and 5,000 to investigate bias and confidence-interval coverage under several scenarios. In a simple confounding scenario, confounders were related to the treatment and the outcome via parametric models. In a complex confounding scenario, the simple confounders were transformed to induce complicated nonlinear relationships. In the simple scenario, when ML algorithms were used, double-robust estimators were superior to singly robust estimators. In the complex scenario, single-robust estimators with ML algorithms were at least as biased as estimators using misspecified parametric models. Doubly robust estimators were less biased, but coverage was well below nominal. The use of sample splitting, inclusion of confounder interactions, reliance on a richly specified ML algorithm, and use of doubly robust estimators was the only explored approach that yielded negligible bias and nominal coverage. Our results suggest that ML-based singly robust methods should be avoided.},

  abstract = {Methods for causal inference have experienced tremendous recent growth; this paper introduces key concepts underlying causal effect methods in epidemiologic research. “Causal effects” can be described using counterfactuals, which consider alternate versions of reality, and have a long history of use for interpreting cause-effect relationships in terms of what would have happened had things (e.g., exposures) been one way vs. another. Despite their intuitive appeal for thinking about causality, use of counterfactuals in formal causal inference requires attention to potential limitations. For example, consider a study of the effect of smoking on the 5-year cumulative risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of ambiguity in the “effect of smoking,” the corresponding counterfactual contrast is unclear and could correspond to a comparison between risk that would have happened if all study participants had ever smoked vs. never smoked, smoked 3 vs. 2 cigarettes per day, continued to smoke vs. quitting, and so on (1). There is an important degree of ambiguity in the language we use informally to ask causal questions. Causal inference is largely devoted to clarifying this ambiguity through use of potential outcomes as a formal framework, and a set of assumptions to allow interpretation of associations causally.},

  abstract = {Background Quinolinic acid (QA), a neuroactive metabolite of the Kynurenine Pathway (KP), is an excitotoxin that is implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurological disorders. KP is the main tryptophan degradation pathway. Phthalates can structurally mimic tryptophan metabolites and diets containing phthalates in rats enhanced the production and excretion of QA. However, there are no human studies that have examined the association between phthalates and QA. Objectives Taking advantage of different mesalamine formulations with/without dibutyl phthalate (DBP), we assessed whether DBP from mesalamine ({$>$}1000x background) altered the urinary concentrations of QA. Methods Men with inflammatory bowel disease participated in a prospective crossover pilot study. 15 Men were on non-DBP mesalamine (background) at baseline crossed-over for 4 months to high-DBP mesalamine (high) (B1H-Arm) and vice versa for 15 men who were on high-DBP mesalamine at baseline (H1B-Arm). Men provided 60 urine samples (2/man). We estimated crossover and cross-sectional changes in the creatinine normalized-QA using multivariable linear mixed effect models with random intercepts. Results At baseline, men who were on high-DBP mesalamine (H1B-Arm) had 72\%, (95\% confidence interval (CI): 18, 151) higher normalized-QA than men who were on background exposure and when high-DBP mesalamine was removed for four months, normalized-QA decreased with 32\%, (95\% CI: −45.0, −15.1). Consistently, when men in B1H-Arm were newly-exposed to high-DBP mesalamine, normalized-QA increased with 11\%, (95\% CI: −11, 38). Conclusions High-DBP exposure from mesalamine increased the urinary concentrations of QA, which was largely reversed after removal of the high-DBP exposure for four months. This novel hypothesis should warrant new promising research considering the KP and QA concentrations as a plausible mediator for the neurotoxicity possibly linked with phthalate exposures.},

  abstract = {Background Despite early childhood weight gain being a key indicator of obesity risk, we do not have a good understanding of the different patterns that exist. Objectives To identify and characterise distinct groups of children displaying similar early-life weight trajectories. Methods A growth mixture model captured heterogeneity in weight trajectories between 0 and 60 months in 1390 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Differences between the classes in characteristics and body size/composition at 9 years were investigated. Results The best model had five classes. The “Normal” (45\%) and “Normal after initial catch-down” (24\%) classes were close to the 50th centile of a growth standard between 24 and 60 months. The “High-decreasing” (21\%) and “Stable-high” (7\%) classes peaked at the 91st centile at 12-18 months, but while the former declined to the 75th centile and comprised constitutionally big children, the latter did not. The “Rapidly increasing” (3\%) class gained weight from below the 50th centile at 4 months to above the 91st centile at 60 months. By 9 years, their mean body mass index (BMI) placed them at the 98th centile. This class was characterised by the highest maternal BMI; highest parity; highest levels of gestational hypertension and diabetes; and the lowest socio-economic position. At 9 years, the “Rapidly increasing” class was estimated to have 68.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 48.3, 88.1) more fat mass than the “Normal” class, but only 14.0\% (95\% CI 9.1, 18.9) more lean mass. Conclusions Criteria used in growth monitoring practice are unlikely to consistently distinguish between the different patterns of weight gain reported here.},

  abstract = {There may be a bidirectional relationship between cognition and adiposity, whereby poor cognition leads to increased adiposity and vice versa. We aimed to determine whether these findings are causal, by undertaking a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study.A total of 378{$\mkern1mu$}877 UK Biobank participants had three adiposity indicators [body fat percentage (BF\%), body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio] and two cognitive function measures (reaction time, visual memory). We examined observational associations between each adiposity indicator and cognitive function and vice versa. Using bidirectional inverse-variance weighted MR, we estimated the strength of the adiposity-cognitive function association using genetic instruments for adiposity indicators as our exposures, and we repeated this in the opposite direction using instruments for cognitive function.In the direction adiposity to cognitive function, MR analyses were generally directionally consistent with observational findings, but all confidence intervals contained the null. In the opposite direction, MR estimates for all adiposity measures on reaction time were imprecise and directionally inconsistent. MR estimates for the effects of visual memory on all adiposity measures indicated worse visual memory was associated with lower adiposity. For example, a 1-unit worse visual memory score was associated with a 1.32\% [β\,=\,−1.32; 95\% confidence interval (CI): −0.77,−1.88] and 3.57\% (β\,=\,−3.64; 95\% CI: −1.84,−5.15) lower absolute body fat percentage and relative body mass index, respectively.Observational associations of adiposity on cognitive function are likely not causal. In the reverse direction, our consistent findings that worse visual memory is associated with three adiposity indicators provide support for a causal link between worse visual memory and lower adiposity.},

  abstract = {Objectives The observed associations between smoking and functional measures at older ages are vulnerable to bias and confounding. Mendelian randomisation (MR) uses genotype as an instrumental variable to estimate unconfounded causal associations. We conducted a meta-analysis of the observational associations and implemented an MR approach using the smoking-related single nucleotide polymorphism rs16969968 to explore their causal nature. Setting 9 British cohorts belonging to the HALCyon collaboration. Participants Individual participant data on N=26 692 individuals of European ancestry (N from earliest phase analysed per study) of mean ages 50–79 years were available for inclusion in observational meta-analyses of the primary outcomes. Primary outcomes Physical capability, cognitive capability and cognitive decline. The smoking exposures were cigarettes per day, current versus ex-smoker, current versus never smoker and ever versus never smoker. Results In observational analyses current and ever smoking were generally associated with poorer physical and cognitive capability. For example, current smokers had a general fluid cognition score which was 0.17 z-score units (95\% CI −0.221 to −0.124) lower than ex-smokers in cross-sectional analyses. Current smokers had a walk speed which was 0.25 z-score units lower than never smokers (95\% CI −0.338 to −0.170). An MR instrumental variable approach for current versus ex-smoker and number of cigarettes smoked per day produced CIs which neither confirmed nor refuted the observational estimates. The number of genetic associations stratified by smoking status were consistent with type I error. Conclusions Our observational analysis supports the hypothesis that smoking is detrimental to physical and cognitive capability. Further studies are needed for a suitably powered MR approach.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown mixed evidence on the associations between mobility data and COVID-19 case rates, analysis of which is complicated by differences between places on factors influencing both behavior and health outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the county-level impact of shifting the distribution of mobility on the growth in COVID-19 case rates from June 1 - November 14, 2020. We utilized a modified treatment policy (MTP) approach, which considers the impact of shifting an exposure away from its observed value. The MTP approach facilitates studying the effects of continuous exposures while minimizing parametric modeling assumptions. Ten mobility indices were selected to capture several aspects of behavior expected to influence and be influenced by COVID-19 case rates. The outcome was defined as the number of new cases per 100,000 residents two weeks ahead of each mobility measure. Primary analyses used targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with a Super Learner ensemble of machine learning algorithms, considering over 20 potential confounders capturing counties' recent case rates as well as social, economic, health, and demographic variables. For comparison, we also implemented unadjusted analyses. For most weeks considered, unadjusted analyses suggested strong associations between mobility indices and subsequent growth in case rates. However, after confounder adjustment, none of the indices showed consistent associations after hypothetical shifts to reduce mobility. While identifiability concerns limit our ability to make causal claims in this analysis, MTPs are a powerful and underutilized tool for studying the effects of continuous exposures.},

This study examined associations of concurrent exposure to non-persistent chemicals with ADHD symptoms in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay, and typical development. Methods A total of 574 children aged 2-5 years from the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) case-control study was administered the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). This study focused on the Hyperactivity subscale and its two subdomains (hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention). Sixty-two chemicals from four classes (phenols/parabens, phthalates, organophosphate pesticides, trace elements) were quantified in child urine samples, and 43 chemicals detected in {$>$}\,70\% samples were used in statistical analyses. Weighted quantile sum regression for negative binomial outcomes with repeated holdout validation was performed to investigate covariate-adjusted associations between mixtures and ABC scores in 574 children. The mixture analyses were further restricted to 232 children with ASD. Results Phthalate metabolite mixtures, weighted for mono-n-butylphthalate (MNBP), mono-2-heptyl phthalate, and mono-carboxy isononyl phthalate, were associated with the Hyperactivity subscale (mean incidence rate ratio [mIRR]\,=\,1.11; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.00, 1.23), especially the hyperactivity/impulsivity subdomain (mIRR\,=\,1.14; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.06, 1.26). These associations remained similar after restricting to children with ASD. The inattention subdomain was associated with a phenols/parabens mixture, weighted for several parabens and bisphenols (mIRR\,=\,1.13; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.00, 1.28) and a total mixture, weighted for 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid, MNBP, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mIRR\,=\,1.11; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.01, 1.25) only among children with ASD. Conclusions Concurrent exposure to phthalate mixtures was associated with hyperactivity in early childhood. Though causal inference cannot be made based on our cross-sectional findings, this study warrants further research on mixtures of larger number of chemicals from multiple classes in association with ADHD-related behaviors in young children.},

  abstract = {Introduction We have recently shown that sperm epigenetic age (SEA), a surrogate measure of biological aging in sperm, is associated with couples’ time-to-pregnancy (TTP). Advanced SEA was also observed among smokers, suggesting its susceptibility to environmental exposures. Therefore, we assessed the association between urinary phthalate metabolites and SEA in male partners of couples planning to conceive among the general population. Method The Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) Study was a prospective multi-site and general population cohort study of couples who were interested in becoming pregnant. Among male partners (n~=~333), eleven urinary phthalate metabolites were measured and SEA was previously developed using Super Learner ensemble algorithm. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate associations of SEA with individual metabolites. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), quantile g-computation (qgcomp) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) models were used for mixture analyses. Covariates included were BMI, cotinine, race and urinary creatinine. Result In the single metabolite multivariate analyses, nine (82\%) phthalate metabolites displayed positive trends with SEA (range: 0.05–0.47 years). Of these metabolites, advanced SEA was significantly associated with interquartile range increases in exposure of three phthalates [MEHHP (β~=~0.23, 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.43, p~=~0.03), MMP (β~=~0.24, 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.47, p~=~0.04), and MiBP (β~=~0.47, 95\% CI: 0.14, 0.81, p~=~0.01)]. Additionally, in BKMR and qgcomp (p~=~0.06), but not WQS models, phthalate mixtures showed an overall positive trend with SEA, with MiBP, MMP and MBzP as major drivers of the mixture effects. Conclusion This is the first study that combined single exposure and mixture models to associate male phthalate exposures with advanced epigenetic aging of sperm in men planning to conceive among the general population. Our findings suggest that phthalate exposure may contribute to the acceleration of biological aging of sperm.},

  abstract = {Devising computational methods to accurately reconstruct gene regulatory networks given gene expression data is key to systems biology applications. Here we propose a method for reconstructing gene regulatory networks by simultaneous consideration of data sets from different perturbation experiments and corresponding controls. The method imposes three biologically meaningful constraints: (1) expression levels of each gene should be explained by the expression levels of a small number of transcription factor coding genes, (2) networks inferred from different data sets should be similar with respect to the type and number of regulatory interactions and (3) relationships between genes which exhibit similar differential behavior over the considered perturbations should be favored. We demonstrate that these constraints can be transformed in a fused LASSO formulation for the proposed method. The comparative analysis on transcriptomics time-series data from prokaryotic species, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as a eukaryotic species, mouse, demonstrated that the proposed method has the advantages of the most recent approaches for regulatory network inference, while obtaining better performance and assigning higher scores to the true regulatory links. The study indicates that the combination of sparse regression techniques with other biologically meaningful constraints is a promising framework for gene regulatory network reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Human health and well-being are intricately linked to environmental quality. Environmental exposures can have lifelong consequences. In particular, exposures during the vulnerable fetal or early development period can affect structure, physiology and metabolism, causing potential adverse, often permanent, health effects at any point in life. External exposures, such as the “chemical exposome” (exposures to environmental chemicals), affect the host’s metabolism and immune system, which, in turn, mediate the risk of various diseases. Linking such exposures to adverse outcomes, via intermediate phenotypes such as the metabolome, is one of the central themes of exposome research. Much progress has been made in this line of research, including addressing some key challenges such as analytical coverage of the exposome and metabolome, as well as the integration of heterogeneous, multi-omics data. There is strong evidence that chemical exposures have a marked impact on the metabolome, associating with specific disease risks. Herein, we review recent progress in the field of exposome research as related to human health as well as selected metabolic and autoimmune diseases, with specific emphasis on the impacts of chemical exposures on the host metabolome.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Background             Although biomonitoring studies demonstrate that the general population experiences exposure to multiple chemicals, most environmental epidemiology studies consider each chemical separately when assessing adverse effects of environmental exposures. Hence, the critical need for novel approaches to handle multiple correlated exposures.                                   Methods             We propose a novel approach using the G-formula, a maximum likelihood-based substitution estimator, combined with an ensemble learning technique (i.e. SuperLearner) to infer causal effect estimates for a multi-pollutant mixture. We simulated four continuous outcomes from real data on 5 correlated exposures under four exposure-response relationships with increasing complexity and 500 replications. The first simulated exposure-response was generated as a linear function depending on two exposures; the second was based on a univariate nonlinear exposure-response relationship; the third was generated as a linear exposure-response relationship depending on two exposures and their interaction; the fourth simulation was based on a non-linear exposure-response relationship with an effect modification by sex and a linear relationship with a second exposure. We assessed the method based on its predictive performance (Minimum Square error [MSE]), its ability to detect the true predictors and interactions (i.e. false discovery proportion, sensitivity), and its bias. We compared the method with generalized linear and additive models, elastic net, random forests, and Extreme gradient boosting. Finally, we reconstructed the exposure-response relationships and developed a toolbox for interactions visualization using individual conditional expectations.                                   Results             The proposed method yielded the best average MSE across all the scenarios, and was therefore able to adapt to the true underlying structure of the data. The method succeeded to detect the true predictors and interactions, and was less biased in all the scenarios. Finally, we could correctly reconstruct the exposure-response relationships in all the simulations.                                   Conclusions             This is the first approach combining ensemble learning techniques and causal inference to unravel the effects of chemical mixtures and their interactions in epidemiological studies. Additional developments including high dimensional exposure data, and testing for detection of low to moderate associations will be carried out in future developments.},

  abstract = {Background Investigators measuring exposure biomarkers in urine typically adjust for creatinine to account for dilution-dependent sample variation in urine concentrations. Similarly, it is standard to adjust for serum lipids when measuring lipophilic chemicals in serum. However, there is controversy regarding the best approach, and existing methods may not effectively correct for measurement error. Objectives We compared adjustment methods, including novel approaches, using simulated case–control data. Methods Using a directed acyclic graph framework, we defined six causal scenarios for epidemiologic studies of environmental chemicals measured in urine or serum. The scenarios include variables known to influence creatinine (e.g., age and hydration) or serum lipid levels (e.g., body mass index and recent fat intake). Over a range of true effect sizes, we analyzed each scenario using seven adjustment approaches and estimated the corresponding bias and confidence interval coverage across 1,000 simulated studies. Results For urinary biomarker measurements, our novel method, which incorporates both covariate-adjusted standardization and the inclusion of creatinine as a covariate in the regression model, had low bias and possessed 95\% confidence interval coverage of nearly 95\% for most simulated scenarios. For serum biomarker measurements, a similar approach involving standardization plus serum lipid level adjustment generally performed well. Conclusions To control measurement error bias caused by variations in serum lipids or by urinary diluteness, we recommend improved methods for standardizing exposure concentrations across individuals.

  abstract = {Human brain development is a complex multistep process that is partly coordinated by the endocrine system. Any interference with the endocrine system might affect this process and result in deleterious outcomes. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) represent a large group of exogenous chemicals with the capacity of interfering with endocrine functions. In different population-based settings, associations between exposure to EDCs, particularly in prenatal life, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes have been demonstrated. These findings are strengthened by numerous experimental studies. Although mechanisms underlying these associations are not entirely delineated, disruption of thyroid hormone and, to a lesser extent, sex hormone signalling have been shown to be involved. Humans are constantly exposed to mixtures of EDCs, and further research combining epidemiological and experimental settings is required to improve our understanding of the link between real-life exposures to these chemicals and their impact on neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {The burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight is considerable across the world. Several risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes have been identified. One risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes receiving considerable attention in recent years is gestational exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Humans are exposed to a multitude of environmental chemicals with known endocrine-disrupting properties, and evidence suggests exposure to these EDCs have the potential to disrupt the maternal-fetal environment culminating in adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. This review addresses the impact of maternal and fetal exposure to environmental EDCs of natural and man-made chemicals in disrupting the maternal-fetal milieu in human leading to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes—a risk factor for adult-onset noncommunicable diseases, the role lifestyle and environmental factors play in mitigating or amplifying the effects of EDCs, the underlying mechanisms and mediators involved, and the research directions on which to focus future investigations to help alleviate the adverse effects of EDC exposure.,  Graphical Abstract},

  abstract = {Since its first release over a decade ago, the MetaboAnalyst web-based platform has become widely used for comprehensive metabolomics data analysis and interpretation. Here we introduce MetaboAnalyst version 5.0, aiming to narrow the gap from raw data to functional insights for global metabolomics based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Three modules have been developed to help achieve this goal, including: (i) a LC–MS Spectra Processing module which offers an easy-to-use pipeline that can perform automated parameter optimization and resumable analysis to significantly lower the barriers to LC-MS1 spectra processing; (ii) a Functional Analysis module which expands the previous MS Peaks to Pathways module to allow users to intuitively select any peak groups of interest and evaluate their enrichment of potential functions as defined by metabolic pathways and metabolite sets; (iii) a Functional Meta-Analysis module to combine multiple global metabolomics datasets obtained under complementary conditions or from similar studies to arrive at comprehensive functional insights. There are many other new functions including weighted joint-pathway analysis, data-driven network analysis, batch effect correction, merging technical replicates, improved compound name matching, etc. The web interface, graphics and underlying codebase have also been refactored to improve performance and user experience. At the end of an analysis session, users can now easily switch to other compatible modules for a more streamlined data analysis. MetaboAnalyst 5.0 is freely available at https://www.metaboanalyst.ca.},

  abstract = {Phthalates have been linked to changes in child neurodevelopment. However, sex-specificity has been reported inconsistently, and little is known about the impact of recent phthalate replacement chemicals. Our analysis included mother–child pairs (N = 274) from the PROTECT birth cohort in Puerto Rico. Phthalate metabolites were measured in multiple maternal urine collected during pregnancy. Neurodevelopment was measured at 6, 12, and 24 months of age using the Battelle Developmental Inventory-2nd edition (BDI), which provides scores for adaptive, personal-social, communication, motor, and cognitive domains. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations between phthalate metabolite concentrations and BDI scores, adjusting for maternal age, maternal education, child age, and specific gravity. Sex-specificity was assessed with sex X exposure interaction terms and stratified models. Results show that all five domains were significantly associated with mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) at age 24 months, suggesting a holistic developmental delay related to this metabolite. Sex-specificity existed for all timepoints (p-interaction {$<$} 0.2), in general, showing stronger associations among boys. For example, metabolites of a recent phthalate replacement, di-2-ethylhexyl terephthalate (DEHTP), were differentially associated with the adaptive domain (boys −7.53\%/IQR, 95\% CI: −14.58, −0.48 vs. girls −0.85\%/IQR, 95\% CI: −5.08, 3.37), and the cognitive domain (boys −6.05\%/IQR, 95\% CI: −10.88, −1.22 vs. girls −1.93\%/IQR, 95\%CI: −4.14, 0.28) at 6 months. To conclude, gestational exposure to phthalates and phthalate replacements was associated with neurodevelopmental delay across multiple domains, with differences by sex and child age.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the consistency of causal statements in observational studies published in The BMJ. Design Review of observational studies published in a general medical journal. Data source Cohort and other longitudinal studies describing an exposure-outcome relationship published in The BMJ in 2018. We also had access to the submitted papers and reviewer reports. Main outcome measures Proportion of published research papers with ‘inconsistent’ use of causal language. Papers where language was consistently causal or non-causal were classified as ‘consistently causal’ or ‘consistently not causal’, respectively. For the ‘inconsistent’ papers, we then compared the published and submitted version. Results Of 151 published research papers, 60 described eligible studies. Of these 60, we classified the causal language used as ‘consistently causal’ (48\%), ‘inconsistent’ (20\%) and ‘consistently not causal’(32\%). Eleven out of 12 (92\%) of the ‘inconsistent’ papers were already inconsistent on submission. The inconsistencies found in both submitted and published versions were mainly due to mismatches between objectives and conclusions. One section might be carefully phrased in terms of association while the other presented causal language. When identifying only an association, some authors jumped to recommending acting on the findings as if motivated by the evidence presented. Conclusion Further guidance is necessary for authors on what constitutes a causal statement and how to justify or discuss assumptions involved. Based on screening these papers, we provide a list of expressions beyond the obvious ‘cause’ word which may inspire a useful more comprehensive compendium on causal language.},

Some phthalates have anti-androgenic properties; a prior study reported an association between gestational exposure to phthalates and reduced masculine behaviors in preschool boys. METHODS: Concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites were measured in urine collected at 16 and 26~weeks' gestation from pregnant women enrolled in the HOME Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort. Measures of gender-related play were collected at 8~years of age, including the Gender Identity Questionnaire (GIQ) completed by mothers, and the Playmate and Play Style Preferences Structured Interview (PPPSI) completed by children. We examined these measures as continuous variables using both bivariate and multivariable approaches with adjustment for covariates. Additional analyses included logistic regression of GIQ and PPPSI scores dichotomized by sex at the lower 25th percentile, indicating the least typical behavior. RESULTS: Mothers' phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy were similar to the reported national average among US women. All children scored within a typical range on both measures of gender-related play behavior. No statistically significant associations were found between averaged maternal phthalate metabolite concentrations and continuous PPPSI scores or any GIQ scores. For the dichotomized PPPSI; higher maternal monoethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations were associated with more typical play behaviors for females (OR\,=\,0.70, CI\,=\,0.51-0.97). In contrast, higher maternal mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) concentrations were associated with higher odds of membership in the least typical play behaviors group for males (OR\,=\,1.69, CI\,=\,1.00-2.86). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of typically developing children, higher maternal urinary MEP concentrations during pregnancy were associated with more typical gender-related play behaviors in both males and females, and increased urinary MiBP concentrations were associated with less masculine gender-related play behaviors in males.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential for drawing conclusions regarding etiologic associations between exposures or interventions and health outcomes. Observational studies comprise a substantive source of the evidence base. One major threat to their validity is residual confounding, which may occur when component studies adjust for different sets of confounders, fail to control for important confounders, or have classification errors resulting in only partial control of measured confounders. We present the confounder matrix—an approach for defining and summarizing adequate confounding control in systematic reviews of observational studies and incorporating this assessment into meta-analyses. First, an expert group reaches consensus regarding the core confounders that should be controlled and the best available method for their measurement. Second, a matrix graphically depicts how each component study accounted for each confounder. Third, the assessment of control adequacy informs quantitative synthesis. We illustrate the approach with studies of the association between short interpregnancy intervals and preterm birth. Our findings suggest that uncontrolled confounding, notably by reproductive history and sociodemographics, resulted in exaggerated estimates. Moreover, no studies adequately controlled for all core confounders, so we suspect residual confounding is present, even among studies with better control. The confounder matrix serves as an extension of previously published methodological guidance for observational research synthesis, enabling transparent reporting of confounding control and directly informing meta-analysis so that conclusions are drawn from the best available evidence. Widespread application could raise awareness about gaps across a body of work and allow for more valid inference with respect to confounder control.},

Aims We aimed to study the associations between the use of PCPs and urinary concentrations of biomarkers of select phenols and phthalates among Californian adults and their children. As an additional aim we compared phenols and phthalate metabolites concentrations measured in adults and children urine samples collected the same day. Methods Our study relied on a subsample of 90 adult–child pairs participating in the Study of Use of Products and Exposure Related Behavior (SUPERB). Each adult and child provided one to two urine samples in which we measured concentrations of selected phenols and phthalate metabolites. We computed Spearman correlation coefficients to compare concentrations measured in adults and children urine samples collected the same day. We used adjusted linear and Tobit regression models to study the associations between the use of PCPs in the past 24h and biomarker concentrations. Results Benzophenone-3 and parabens concentrations were higher in adults compared to their children. Conversely children had higher mono-n-butyl phthalate and mono-isobutyl phthalate concentrations. No significant difference was observed for the other compounds. The total number of different PCPs used was positively associated with urinary concentrations of methyl, propyl and butyl parabens and the main metabolite of diethyl phthalate in adults. Among children, the use of a few specific products including liquid soap, hair care products and sunscreen was positively associated with urinary concentrations of some phenols or phthalate metabolites. Discussion These results strengthen the body of evidence suggesting that use of PCPs is an important source of exposure to parabens and diethyl phthalate in adults and provide data on exposure to selected phenols and phthalates through use of PCPs in children.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenols interact with nuclear receptors implicated in growth and adipogenesis regulation. Only a few studies have explored their effects on growth in humans. OBJECTIVES: We studied the associations of maternal exposure to phenols during pregnancy with prenatal and postnatal growth of male newborns. METHODS: Within a cohort of women recruited during pregnancy, we selected 520 mother-son pairs and quantified 9 phenols in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy. We used ultrasonography during pregnancy, together with birth measurements, to assess fetal growth. We modeled individual postnatal growth trajectories from repeated measures of weight and height in the first 3 years of life. RESULTS: Triclosan concentration was negatively associated with growth parameters measured at the third ultrasound examination but not earlier in pregnancy. At birth, this phenol tended to be negatively associated with head circumference (-1.2 mm for an interquartile range [IQR] increase in ln-transformed triclosan concentration [95\% confidence interval = -2.6 to 0.3]) but not with weight or height. Parabens were positively associated with weight at birth. This positive association remained for 3 years for methylparaben (β = 193 g [-4 to 389]) for an IQR increase in ln-transformed concentrations. CONCLUSION: We relied on only 1 spot urine sample to assess exposure; because of the high variability in phenol urinary concentrations reported during pregnancy, using only 1 sample may result in exposure misclassification, in particular for bisphenol A. Our study suggested associations between prenatal exposure to parabens and triclosan and prenatal or early postnatal growth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data concerning the effects of prenatal exposures to phthalates and phenols on fetal growth are limited in humans. Previous findings suggest possible effects of some phenols on male birth weight. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the relationships between prenatal exposures to phthalates and phenols and fetal growth among male newborns. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on male malformations of the genitalia nested in two French mother-child cohorts with recruitment between 2002 and 2006. We measured, in maternal urinary samples collected between 6 and 30 gestational weeks, the concentrations (micrograms per liter) of 9 phenol (n = 191 pregnant women) and 11 phthalate metabolites (n = 287). Weight, length, and head circumference at birth were collected from maternity records. Statistical analyses were corrected for the oversampling of malformation cases. RESULTS: Adjusted birth weight decreased by 77 g [95\% confidence interval (CI): -129, -25] and by 49 g (95\% CI: -86, -13) in association with a 1-unit increase in ln-transformed 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) and 2,5-DCP urinary concentrations, respectively. Benzophenone-3 (BP3) ln-transformed concentrations were positively associated with weight (26 g; 95\% CI: -2, 54) and head circumference at birth (0.1 cm; 95\% CI: 0.0, 0.2). Head circumference increased by 0.3 cm (95\% CI: 0.0, 0.7) in association with a 1-unit increase in ln-transformed BPA concentration. For phthalate metabolites there was no evidence of monotonic associations with birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings of a previous study, we observed evidence of an inverse association of 2,5-DCP and a positive association of BP3 with male birth weight.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure. In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

  abstract = {Background Genetic influences are ubiquitous as virtually all phenotypes and most exposures typically classified as environmental have been found to be heritable. A polygenic score summarises the associations between millions of genetic variants and an outcome in a single value for each individual. Ever lowering costs have enabled the genotyping of many samples relevant to child psychology and psychiatry research, including cohort studies, leading to the proliferation of polygenic score studies. It is tempting to assume that associations detected between polygenic scores and phenotypes in those studies only reflect genetic effects. However, such associations can reflect many pathways (e.g. via environmental mediation) and biases. Methods Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the many reasons why associations between polygenic scores, environmental exposures, and phenotypes exist. We include formal representations of common analyses in polygenic score studies using structural equation modelling. We derive biases, provide illustrative empirical examples and, when possible, mention steps that can be taken to alleviate those biases. Results Structural equation models and derivations show the many complexities arising from jointly modelling polygenic scores with environmental exposures and phenotypes. Counter-intuitive examples include that: (a) associations between polygenic scores and phenotypes may exist even in the absence of direct genetic effects; (b) associations between child polygenic scores and environmental exposures can exist in the absence of evocative/active gene–environment correlations; and (c) adjusting an exposure-outcome association for a polygenic score can increase rather than decrease bias. Conclusions Strikingly, using polygenic scores may, in some cases, lead to more bias than not using them. Appropriately conducting and interpreting polygenic score studies thus requires researchers in child psychology and psychiatry and beyond to be versed in both epidemiological and genetic methods or build on interdisciplinary collaborations.},

We propose a two-stage approach for estimating the degree to which such observed associations can be explained by genetic confounding. First, we assess attenuation of exposure effects in regressions controlling for increasingly powerful polygenic scores. Second, we use structural equation models to estimate genetic confounding using heritability estimates derived from both SNP-based and twin-based studies. We examine associations between maternal education and three developmental outcomes – child educational achievement, Body Mass Index, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Polygenic scores explain between 14.3\% and 23.0\% of the original associations, while analyses under SNP- and twin-based heritability scenarios indicate that observed associations could be almost entirely explained by genetic confounding. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting associations from non-genetically informed epidemiology studies. Our approach, akin to a genetically informed sensitivity analysis can be applied widely.},

The modern environment is replete with man-made compounds such as plastic product chemicals (PPC), including phenols and phthalates. Evidence from several human cohorts implicates exposure to these chemicals in adverse offspring neurodevelopment, though a direct causal relationship has not been firmly established. In this review we consider a potential causal pathway that encompasses epigenetic human variation, and how we might test this mechanistic hypothesis in human studies. In the first part of this report we outline how PPCs induce epigenetic change, focusing on the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, a key regulator of neurodevelopment. Further, we discuss the role of the epigenetics of BDNF and other genes in neurodevelopment and the emerging human evidence of an association between phthalate exposure and adverse offspring neurodevelopment. We discuss aspects of epidemiological and molecular study design and analysis that could be employed to strengthen the level of human evidence to infer causality. We undertake this using an exemplar recent research example: maternal prenatal smoking, linked to methylation change at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene at birth, now shown to mediate some of the effects of maternal smoking on birth weight. Characterizing the relationship between the modern environment and the human molecular pathways underpinning its impact on early development is paramount to understanding the public health significance of modern day chemical exposures.},

  abstract = {The number of people affected by Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is close to half a billion and is on a sharp rise, representing a major and growing public health burden. Given its mild initial symptoms, T2DM is often diagnosed several years after its onset, leaving half of diabetic individuals undiagnosed. While several classical clinical and genetic biomarkers have been identified, improving early diagnosis by exploring other kinds of omics data remains crucial. In this study, we have combined longitudinal data from two population-based cohorts CoLaus and DESIR (comprising in total 493 incident cases vs. 1360 controls) to identify new or confirm previously implicated metabolomic biomarkers predicting T2DM incidence more than 5 years ahead of clinical diagnosis. Our longitudinal data have shown robust evidence for valine, leucine, carnitine and glutamic acid being predictive of future conversion to T2DM. We confirmed the causality of such association for leucine by 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on independent data. Our MR approach further identified new metabolites potentially playing a causal role on T2D, including betaine, lysine and mannose. Interestingly, for valine and leucine a strong reverse causal effect was detected, indicating that the genetic predisposition to T2DM may trigger early changes of these metabolites, which appear well-before any clinical symptoms. In addition, our study revealed a reverse causal effect of metabolites such as glutamic acid and alanine. Collectively, these findings indicate that molecular traits linked to the genetic basis of T2DM may be particularly promising early biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Ambient air pollution exposure is associated with cardiovascular dysregulation and immune system alterations, yet no study has investigated both simultaneously in children. Understanding the multifaceted impacts may provide early clues for clinical intervention prior to actual disease presentation. We therefore determined the associations between exposure to multiple air pollutants and both immunological outcomes (methylation and protein expression of immune cell types associated with immune regulation) and cardiovascular outcomes (blood pressure) in a cohort of school-aged children (6–8~years; n\,=\,221) living in a city with known elevated pollution levels. Exposure to fine particular matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) was linked to altered methylation of most CpG sites for genes Foxp3, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-g, all involved in immune regulation (e.g. higher PM2.5 exposure 1~month prior to the study visit was independently associated with methylation of the IL-4 CpG24 site (est\,=\,0.16; P\,=\,0.0095). Also, immune T helper cell types (Th1, Th2 and Th17) were associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, O3 and CO (e.g. Th1 cells associated with PM2.5 at 30~days: est\,=\,−~0.34, P\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Both B cells (est\,=\,−~0.19) and CD4+ cells (est\,=\,0.16) were associated with 1~day NO2 exposure (P\,≤\,0.031), whereas CD4+ and CD8+ cells were associated with chronic exposure to PAH456, NOx and/or NO2 (P\,≤\,0.038 for all). Finally, diastolic BP (DBP) was inversely associated with long-term exposures to both CO and PAH456, and both systolic and pulse pressure were associated with short-term NO2 and chronic NOx exposure. Our findings demonstrate links between air pollution exposure and methylation of immunoregulatory genes, immune cell profiles and blood pressure, suggesting that even at a young age, the immune and cardiovascular systems are negatively impacted by exposure to air pollution.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathological mechanism and underlying biological processes of these diseases with metabolites remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal effect of metabolites on these diseases by making full use of the latest GWAS summary statistics for 486 metabolites and six major CVDs. Extensive sensitivity analyses were implemented to validate our MR results. We also conducted linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and colocalization analysis to investigate whether MR findings were driven by genetic similarity or hybridization between LD and disease-associated gene loci. We identified a total of 310 suggestive associations across all metabolites and CVDs, and finally obtained four significant associations, including bradykinin, des-arg(9) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.160, 95\% confidence intervals [CIs]: 1.080–1.246, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.022) on ischemic stroke, N-acetylglycine (OR = 0.946, 95\%CIs: 0.920–0.973, FDR = 0.023), X-09026 (OR = 0.845, 95\%CIs: 0.779–0.916, FDR = 0.021) and X-14473 (OR = 0.938, 95\%CIs = 0.907–0.971, FDR = 0.040) on hypertension. Sensitivity analyses showed that these causal associations were robust, the LDSC and colocalization analyses demonstrated that the identified associations were unlikely confused by LD. Moreover, we identified 15 important metabolic pathways might be involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs. Overall, our work identifies several metabolites that have a causal relationship with CVDs, and improves our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment strategies for these diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pesticide use is widespread, the possible effect of early-life exposure to organophosphate (OP) on pediatric respiratory health is not well described. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between early-life exposure to OPs and respiratory outcomes. METHODS: Participants included 359 mothers and children from the CHAMACOS birth cohort. Dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OP pesticides, specifically diethyl (DE) and dimethyl (DM) phosphate metabolites, were measured in urine from mothers twice during pregnancy (mean = 13 and 26 weeks gestation) and from children five times during childhood (0.5-5 years). Childhood DAP concentrations were estimated by the area under curve (AUC). Mothers reported their child's respiratory symptoms at 5 and 7 years of age. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine associations of prenatal and childhood DAP concentrations with repeated measures of respiratory symptoms and exercise-induced coughing at 5 and 7 years of age, adjusting for child's sex and age, maternal smoking during pregnancy, secondhand tobacco smoke, season of birth, PM2.5, breastfeeding, mold and cockroaches in home, and distance from highway. RESULTS: Higher prenatal DAP concentrations, particularly DE, were nonsignificantly associated with respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months at 5 or 7 years of age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per 10-fold increase = 1.44; 95\% CI: 0.98, 2.12]. This association was strongest with total DAP and DE from the second half of pregnancy (aOR per 10-fold increase = 1.77; 95\% CI: 1.06, 2.95; and 1.61; 95\% CI: 1.08, 2.39, respectively). Childhood DAP, DE, and DM concentrations were associated with respiratory symptoms and exercise-induced coughing in the previous 12 months at 5 or 7 years of age (total DAPs: aOR per 10-fold increase = 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.32, 4.86; and aOR = 5.40; 95\% CI: 2.10, 13.91, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Early-life exposure to OP pesticides was associated with respiratory symptoms consistent with possible asthma in childhood.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of the epidemiology literature to identify the neurodevelopmental effects associated with phthalate exposure. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Six phthalates were included in the review: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The initial literature search (of PubMed, Web of Science, and Toxline) included all studies of neurodevelopmental effects in humans, and outcomes were selected for full systematic review based on data availability. STUDY EVALUATION AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Studies of neurodevelopmental effects were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for risk of bias and sensitivity by two reviewers using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and phthalate and strength of evidence was summarized using a structured framework. For studies of cognition and motor effects in children ≤4~years old, a random effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The primary outcomes reviewed here are (number of studies in parentheses): cognition (14), motor effects (9), behavior, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (20), infant behavior (3), and social behavior, including autism spectrum disorder (7). For each phthalate/outcome combination, there was slight or indeterminate evidence of an association, with the exception of motor effects for BBP, which had moderate evidence. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Overall, there is not a clear pattern of association between prenatal phthalate exposures and neurodevelopment. There are several possible reasons for the observed null associations related to exposure misclassification, periods of heightened susceptibility, sex-specific effects, and the effects of phthalate mixtures. Until these limitations are adequately addressed in the epidemiology literature, these findings should not be interpreted as evidence that there are no neurodevelopmental effects of phthalate exposure.

  abstract = {Environmental stressors, like endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), are considered important contributors to the increased rates of neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. Considering the cumulative research on adverse neurodevelopmental effects associated with prenatal exposure to EDC, the purpose of this study was to review the available limited literature about the effects of postnatal exposure to EDC on child neurodevelopment and behaviour. Despite widespread children's exposure to EDC, there are a limited number of epidemiological studies on the association of this exposure with neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular in the postnatal period. The available research suggests that postnatal EDC exposure is related to adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children; however the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Timing of exposure is a key factor determining potential neurodevelopmental consequences, hence studying the impact of multiple EDC co-exposure in different vulnerable life periods could guide the identification of sensitive subpopulations. Most of the reviewed studies did not take into account sex differences in the EDC effects on children neurodevelopment. We believe that the inclusion of sex in the study design should be considered as the role of EDC on children neurodevelopment are likely sex-specific and should be taken into consideration when determining susceptibility and potential mechanisms of action.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that TCS has the potential to act as an endocrine disruptor. The present study tested the hypothesis that TCS acts as an endocrine-disrupting agent in fish. Mature male western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, were exposed to TCS concentrations of 100, 200, and 350 nM (29.0, 57.9, and 101.3 microg/L) for 35 d by the static renewal method. Induction of the normally female-limited vitellogenin gene expression and reduction in sperm count were quantified as biomarkers of endocrine disruption. Vitellogenin mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the 350 nM TCS treatment. Sperm counts in the same treatment group were significantly decreased. The mean hepatosomatic index in the 350 nM treatment group was significantly increased. This study demonstrates that TCS has the potential to act as an endocrine disruptor in male mosquitofish.},

All treated groups experienced atrophy in the ventral prostate and seminal vesicle, likewise significant depletion in the number and motility of sperm. Given individually or combined butylparaben and triclosan, significantly decreased testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Individual treatment with tested compounds caused significant elevation in the E2 level, whereas combined treatment did not alter the E2 level. Testicular DNA damage was recorded in all treated groups. Moreover, the testicular malondialdehyde level was significantly elevated, along with a significant decrease in catalase enzyme activity in all treated groups. Superoxide dismutase enzyme activity was significantly decreased in the butylparaben-treated group, increased in the triclosan-treated group, and nonsignificantly changed the butylparaben-triclosan-treated group. The combined treatment produced an endocrine disturbance with a concomitant induction of testicular oxidative stress, which may represent a common mechanism of endocrine disruptor-mediated dysfunction.},

Consider an observational study of the association between a continuous exposure and an outcome, where the exposure variable of primary interest suffers from classical measurement error (i.e., the measured exposures are distributed around the true exposure with independent error). In the absence of exposure measurement error, it is widely recognized that one should control for confounders of the association of interest to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of that exposure on the outcome of interest. However, here we show that, in the presence of classical exposure measurement error, the net bias in an estimate of the association of interest may increase upon adjustment for confounders. We offer an analytical expression for calculating the change in net bias in an estimate of the association of interest upon adjustment for a confounder in the presence of classical exposure measurement error, and we illustrate this problem using simulations.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate whether body size in early life has an independent effect on risk of disease in later life or whether its influence is mediated by body size in adulthood. Design Two sample univariable and multivariable mendelian randomisation. Setting The UK Biobank prospective cohort study and four large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consortiums. Participants 453 169 participants enrolled in UK Biobank and a combined total of more than 700 000 people from different GWAS consortiums. Exposures Measured body mass index during adulthood (mean age 56.5) and self-reported perceived body size at age 10. Main outcome measures Coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Results Having a larger genetically predicted body size in early life was associated with an increased odds of coronary artery disease (odds ratio 1.49 for each change in body size category unless stated otherwise, 95\% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.68) and type 2 diabetes (2.32, 1.76 to 3.05) based on univariable mendelian randomisation analyses. However, little evidence was found of a direct effect (ie, not through adult body size) based on multivariable mendelian randomisation estimates (coronary artery disease: 1.02, 0.86 to 1.22; type 2 diabetes:1.16, 0.74 to 1.82). In the multivariable mendelian randomisation analysis of breast cancer risk, strong evidence was found of a protective direct effect for larger body size in early life (0.59, 0.50 to 0.71), with less evidence of a direct effect of adult body size on this outcome (1.08, 0.93 to 1.27). Including age at menarche as an additional exposure provided weak evidence of a total causal effect (univariable mendelian randomisation odds ratio 0.98, 95\% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.06) but strong evidence of a direct causal effect, independent of early life and adult body size (multivariable mendelian randomisation odds ratio 0.90, 0.85 to 0.95). No strong evidence was found of a causal effect of either early or later life measures on prostate cancer (early life body size odds ratio 1.06, 95\% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.40; adult body size 0.87, 0.70 to 1.08). Conclusions The findings suggest that the positive association between body size in childhood and risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes in adulthood can be attributed to individuals remaining large into later life. However, having a smaller body size during childhood might increase the risk of breast cancer regardless of body size in adulthood, with timing of puberty also putatively playing a role.},

Using birth records from California (2007-2017), Nevada (2010-2017), and Oregon (2008-2017) we compared three commonly used approaches to estimate associations between GWG and cesarean delivery (C-section), small for gestational age (SGA), and low birth weight (LBW)]: (1) the Institute of Medicine recommended GWG ranges at a given gestational week, (2) total weight gain categories directly adjusting for gestational age as a covariate, and (3) weight-gain-for-gestational-age z-scores derived from an external longitudinal reference population. Among 5,461,130 births, the three methods yielded similar conclusions for C-section and SGA. However, for LBW, some associations based on z-scores were in the opposite direction of methods 1 and 2, paradoxically suggesting higher GWG increases risk of LBW. This was due to a greater proportion of preterm births among those with high z-scores, and controlling for gestational age in the z-score model brought the results in line with the other methods. We conclude that the use of externally-derived GWG z-scores based on ongoing pregnancies can yield associations confounded by duration of pregnancy when the outcome is strongly associated with gestational age at delivery.},

Among adults whose father worked in manual occupations, associations with apolipoprotein A1, large and very large HDL particles and HDL-2 cholesterol remained after adjustment for SEP in later life. Among manual workers, levels of glutamine were higher compared with non-manual workers. All three indicators of low SEP were associated with lower DHA, omega-3 fatty acids and HDL diameter. At all ages, children of manual workers had lower levels of DHA as a proportion of total fatty acids.Our work indicates that social and economic factors have a measurable impact on human physiology. Lower SEP was independently associated with a generally unfavourable metabolic profile, consistent across ages and cohorts. The metabolites we found to be associated with SEP, including DHA, are known to predict cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline in later life and may contribute to health inequalities.},

  abstract = {Background: The urban exposome is the set of environmental factors that are experienced in the outdoor urban environment and that may influence child development. Objective: The authors’ goal was to describe the urban exposome among European pregnant women and understand its socioeconomic determinants. Methods: Using geographic information systems, remote sensing and spatio-temporal modeling we estimated exposure during pregnancy to 28 environmental indicators in almost 30,000 women from six population-based birth cohorts, in nine urban areas from across Europe. Exposures included meteorological factors, air pollutants, traffic noise, traffic indicators, natural space, the built environment, public transport, facilities, and walkability. Socioeconomic position (SEP), assessed at both the area and individual level, was related to the exposome through an exposome-wide association study and principal component (PC) analysis. Results: Mean±standard deviation (SD)  NO 2 NO2  levels ranged from  13.6±5.1 \,μg/m 3 13.6±5.1\,μg/m3  (in Heraklion, Crete) to  43.2±11 \,μg/m 3 43.2±11\,μg/m3  (in Sabadell, Spain),  mean±SD mean±SD  walkability score ranged from  0.22±0.04 0.22±0.04  (Kaunas, Lithuania) to  0.32±0.07 0.32±0.07  (Valencia, Spain) and  mean±SD mean±SD  Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ranged from  0.21±0.05 0.21±0.05  in Heraklion to  0.51±0.1 0.51±0.1  in Oslo, Norway. Four PCs explained more than half of variation in the urban exposome. There was considerable heterogeneity in social patterning of the urban exposome across cities. For example, high-SEP (based on family education) women lived in greener, less noisy, and less polluted areas in Bradford, UK (0.39 higher PC1 score, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.47), but the reverse was observed in Oslo ( −0.57 −0.57  PC1 score, 95\% CI:  −0.73 −0.73 ,  −0.41 −0.41 ). For most cities, effects were stronger when SEP was assessed at the area level: In Bradford, women living in high SEP areas had a 1.34 higher average PC1 score (95\% CI: 1.21, 1.48). Conclusions: The urban exposome showed considerable variability across Europe. Pregnant women of low SEP were exposed to higher levels of environmental hazards in some cities, but not others, which may contribute to inequities in child health and development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2862},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a useful tool to represent, in a graphical format, researchers’ assumptions about the causal structure among variables while providing a rationale for the choice of confounding variables to adjust for. With origins in the field of probabilistic graphical modelling, DAGs are yet to be widely adopted in applied health research, where causal assumptions are frequently made for the purpose of evaluating health services initiatives. In this context, there is still limited practical guidance on how to construct and use DAGs. Some progress has recently been made in terms of building DAGs based on studies from the literature, but an area that has received less attention is how to create DAGs from information provided by domain experts, an approach of particular importance when there is limited published information about the intervention under study. This approach offers the opportunity for findings to be more robust and relevant to patients, carers and the public, and more likely to inform policy and clinical practice. This article draws lessons from a stakeholder workshop involving patients, health care professionals, researchers, commissioners and representatives from industry, whose objective was to draw DAGs for a complex intervention—online consultation, i.e. written exchange between the patient and health care professional using an online system—in the context of the English National Health Service. We provide some initial, practical guidance to those interested in engaging with domain experts to develop DAGs.},

Behavioral studies of pesticide applicators, greenhouse workers, agricultural workers and farm residents exposed repeatedly over months or years to low levels of OPs reveal a relatively consistent pattern of neurobehavioral deficits. However, only two studies have demonstrated a link between neurobehavioral performance and current biomarkers of OP exposure including blood cholinesterase (ChE) activity and urinary levels of OP metabolites. A variety of reasons may explain why so few studies have reported such correlations, including differing individual and group exposure histories, differing methodologies for assessing behavior and exposure, and lack of a reliable index of exposure. Alternatively, these data may suggest that current biomarkers (ChE, urine metabolites) are neither predictive nor diagnostic of the neurobehavioral effects of chronic OP pesticide exposures. This review focuses on the evidence that neurobehavioral performance deficits are associated with occupational OP pesticide exposure and concludes that research needs to return to the basics and rigorously test the relationships between neurobehavioral performance and both current (ChE and urine metabolites) and novel (e.g., inflammation and oxidative stress) biomarkers using human and animal models. The results of such studies are critically important because OP pesticides are widely and extensively used throughout the world, including situations where exposure controls and personal protective equipment are not routinely used.},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals may increase risk of childhood internalizing problems, but few studies have explored the potential for longer-term consequences of such exposures. Objective: We evaluated associations between prenatal organochlorine and metal levels and early adulthood internalizing symptoms, considering whether sociodemographic/nonchemical stressors modified these associations. Methods: Participants were 209 young adults, born (1993–1998) to mothers residing in or near New Bedford, Massachusetts. As part of the early-adult assessment, self-reported anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale) and depressive (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire) symptoms ( ≥10 ≥ 10 : elevated symptoms) were ascertained. We previously analyzed levels of cord serum organochlorines [hexachlorobenzene, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p 𝑝 , p 𝑝 ′-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls ( Σ PCB 4 Σ PCB 4 : sum of congeners 118, 138, 153, 180)] and whole blood lead shortly after participants’ birth, and levels of cord whole blood manganese from archived samples at the time of the adolescent study visit. We used modified Poisson regression models and quantile g-computation, adjusting for sociodemographics, and explored whether biological sex, race/ethnicity (proxy for unmeasured consequences of racism), prenatal social disadvantage (assessed when participants were neonates), and quality of the home environment (assessed during adolescence) modified these associations. Results: Participants were ( mean±standard deviation mean ± standard deviation )  22.1±1.5 22.1 ± 1.5  y old, 76\% Non-Hispanic White, and 67\% female. Prenatal hexachlorobenzene,  p 𝑝 , p 𝑝 ′-DDE, and lead exposures were moderately associated with increased risk of elevated anxiety symptoms. There were strata-specific associations for prenatal social disadvantage and quality of home environment such that adverse associations of  p 𝑝 , p 𝑝 ′-DDE and lead and the overall mixture with anxiety and depressive symptoms were largely only evident in those with lower nonchemical stress [e.g., risk ratio and 95\% confidence interval (CI) per doubling  p 𝑝 , p 𝑝 ′-DDE for anxiety: 1.54 (95\% CI: 1.20, 1.99) in high-quality home environments and 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.51, 1.16) in low-quality home environments]. Associations between prenatal hexachlorobenzene and  p 𝑝 , p 𝑝 ′-DDE and anxiety symptoms were stronger for underrepresented racial/ethnic group participants vs. Non-Hispanic Whites. We found minimal evidence for sex-specific effects, and no consistent associations with manganese or  Σ PCB 4 Σ PCB 4 . Discussion: Prenatal organochlorine pesticides and lead exposure possibly increases risk of internalizing problems, particular anxiety symptoms, in young adults. Varying risk was observed by sociodemographic/nonchemical stressor strata, demonstrating the importance of considering interactions between chemical and other stressors. https://doi-org.sare.upf.edu/10.1289/EHP11171},

The corresponding strategies in control are the ‘high-risk’ approach, which seeks to protect susceptible individuals, and the population approach, which seeks to control the causes of incidence.

  abstract = {The problem of “voodoo” correlations–exceptionally high observed correlations in selected regions of the brain–is well recognized in neuroimaging. It arises when quantities of interest are estimated from the same data that was used to select them as interesting. In statistical terminology, the problem of inference following selection from the same data is that of selective inference. Motivated by the unwelcome side-effects of splitting the data– the recommended remedy–we adapt the recent developments in selective inference in order to construct confidence intervals (CIs) with good reproducibility prospects, even if selection and estimation are done with the same data. These intervals control the expected proportion of non-covered correlations in the selected voxels—the False Coverage Rate (FCR). They extend further toward zero than standard intervals, thus attenuating the impression made by highly biased observed correlations. They do so adaptively, in that they coincide with the standard CIs when far away from the selection point. We complement existing analytic proofs with a simulation, showing that the proposed intervals control the FCR in realistic social neuroscience problems. We also suggest a “confidence calibration plot”, to allow the intervals to be reported in a clear and interpretable way. Applying the proposed methodology on a loss-aversion study, we demonstrate that with the sample size and selection type employed, selection bias is considerable. Finally, selective intervals are compared to the currently recommended data-splitting approach. We discover that our approach has more power and typically more informative, as no data is discarded. Computation of the intervals is implemented in an accompanying software package.},

  abstract = {In a recent article in the Journal, Ogburn et al. (1) highlighted the issues with using predicted values when estimating associations or effects. While the authors cautioned against using predicted values to estimate associations or effects, they noted that predictions can be useful for descriptive purposes. In this work, we highlight the issues with using individual-level predicted values to estimate population-level descriptive parameters.Epidemiologists are often interested in describing some variable of interest Y in a population. Commonly used descriptive parameters are the mean E(Y) and the proportion of the population in which Y falls above or below a threshold t (i.e., the cumulative distribution function (CDF), \$\{F\}\_Y(t)=P\textbackslash!\textbackslash left(Y\textbackslash le t\textbackslash right)\$, or its complement). Sometimes we are not able to directly measure Yi (where i indexes n individuals in the population) but instead have an individual-level prediction of Yi obtained from a model conditional on covariates \$g\textbackslash left(\{Z\}\_i\textbackslash right)=\textbackslash hat\{V\_i\}\$, which estimates the conditional expectation \$\{V\}\_i=E\textbackslash left(Y|\{Z\}\_i\textbackslash right)\$. For simplicity of notation, we suppress the circumflex and subscript i hereafter. When we use such a model, all individuals with Z = z are given the same V even though the true Y values vary, implying that \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Var\}(V)\&lt;\textbackslash mathrm\{Var\}(Y)\$. If we use V in place of Y~to estimate descriptive parameters, descriptive parameters that are linear functions are unbiased but descriptive parameters that are nonlinear functions may be biased (see the Web Appendix, available at https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwad020). For example, the mean value, a linear function, is unbiased (i.e., \$E(V)=E\textbackslash!\textbackslash left(E\textbackslash!\textbackslash left(Y|Z\textbackslash right)\textbackslash right)=E(Y)\$). However, the standard error of the mean, a nonlinear function, is biased. Thus, we will not be able to obtain a valid confidence interval (CI) for the mean using only V. The CDF is also a nonlinear function, so \$\{F\}\_V(t)\textbackslash ne \{F\}\_Y(t)\$. Intuitively, because \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Var\}(V)\&lt;\textbackslash mathrm\{Var\}(Y)\$, the 90th percentile, for example, of V will underestimate the 90th percentile of Y.},

Here, we discuss the difficulty in meeting the positivity condition. Our motivating example is the per-protocol analysis of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) Trial. We estimated the average causal effect comparing the incidence of pregnancy by 26 weeks that would have occurred if all women had been assigned to aspirin and complied versus the incidence if all women had been assigned to placebo and complied. Using flexible targeted minimum loss-based estimation, we estimated a risk difference of 1.27\% (95\% CI: −9.83, 12.38). Using a less flexible inverse probability weighting approach, the risk difference was 5.77\% (95\% CI: −1.13, 13.05). However, the cumulative probability of compliance conditional on covariates approached 0 as follow-up accrued, indicating a practical violation of the positivity assumption, which limited our ability to make causal interpretations. The effects of nonpositivity were more apparent when using a more flexible estimator, as indicated by the greater imprecision. When faced with nonpositivity, one can use a flexible approach and be transparent about the uncertainty, use a parametric approach and smooth over gaps in the data, or target a different estimand that will be less vulnerable to positivity violations.},

We have now adapted this test to study the development of these networks during childhood. The test is a child-friendly version of the flanker task with alerting and orienting cues. We studied the development of the attentional networks in a cross-sectional experiment with four age groups ranging from 6 through 9 (Experiment 1). In a second experiment, we compared children (age 10 years) and adult performance in both child and adults versions of the ANT. Reaction time and accuracy improved at each age interval and positive values were found for the average efficiency of each of the networks. Alertness showed evidence of change up to and beyond age 10, while conflict scores appear stable after age seven and orienting scores do not change in the age range studied. A final experiment with forty 7-year-old children suggested that children like adults showed independence between the three networks under some conditions.},

  abstract = {Triclosan (TCS) is an antibacterial agent that has been used in many products since 1960s. Given its broad usage as an antiseptic TCS is present ubiquitously in the environment. Trace levels of TCS continue to be detected in many organisms, and it has been shown to be particularly toxic to aquatic species. The mechanisms underlying TCS-mediated toxicity include hormone dyshomeostasis, induction of oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation. Although TCS has been considered to be non-toxic to mammals, the adverse effects of continuous, long-term and low concentration exposure remain unknown. Epidemiological studies revealed that levels of TCS in human tissues, urine, plasma and breast milk correlate with the usage of this antimicrobial. This led to concerns regarding TCS safety and potential toxicity in humans, with special emphasis on early development. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a directive banning the use of TCS in consumer soaps, justifying the move attributed to data gaps on its effectiveness and safety, indicating the need for more studies addressing this chemical-mediated effects on various tissues including the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this review was to (1) summarize the current findings on the neurotoxic effects of TCS and given the paucity of data, to (2) broaden the discussion to other effects of TCS, which might plausibly be related to neuronal functions.},

  abstract = {Phthalates (dialkyl or alkyl phenyl esters of phthalic acid, benzene-1.2-dicarboxylic acid) are a group of industrial chemicals that have been used for more than 50 years. Phthalates are ubiquitous and can potentially have adverse effects on humans. The present study presents an accurate, sensitive and automated analytical method for measuring 12 phthalate metabolites (free and conjugated) in human urine using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography – electrospray ionization – tandem mass spectrometry. A small volume of urine sample (300μL) is required. Glucoronidated phthalate metabolites are deconjugated by incubation with glucoronidase enzyme (Escherihia coli-K 12) and the reaction is stopped by adding formic acid. This is the only sample preparation needed prior to injection into the column switching system. Thus, the method involves minimal sample handling and minimizes possible contaminations from the surroundings. The method was validated by spiking synthetic urine at 5–8 levels in the range of 0.1–500ng phthalate metabolites/mL synthetic urine. The method is sensitive with limits of detection in the low nanogram range, and rapid with a total run time about 25min. The accuracy was between 90 and 120 \% and the intermediate precision was given as relative standard deviation was below 20\% for most of the compounds. The high sensitivity, high throughput and minimal manual handling make the method suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies. The present method was applied for the determination of phthalate metabolites in urine samples from 116 pregnant women, a subproject within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Concentrations of all the twelve phthalate metabolites was {$>$}LOQ in 100\% of the samples analysed. Mean urinary concentrations for different phthalate metabolites ranged from 1 to 100ng/mL, the highest concentrations were observed for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and lowest for di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites. The urinary concentrations for most of the phthalate metabolites in the present study were found to be in the same range as found in other studies of pregnant women.},

  abstract = {Many questions in Data Science are fundamentally causal in that our objective is to learn the effect of some exposure, randomized or not, on an outcome interest. Even studies that are seemingly non-causal, such as those with the goal of prediction or prevalence estimation, have causal elements, including differential censoring or measurement. As a result, we, as Data Scientists, need to consider the underlying causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data, rather than simply the pattern or association observed in those data. In this work, we review the 'Causal Roadmap' of Petersen and van der Laan (2014) to provide an introduction to some key concepts in causal inference. Similar to other causal frameworks, the steps of the Roadmap include clearly stating the scientific question, defining of the causal model, translating the scientific question into a causal parameter, assessing the assumptions needed to express the causal parameter as a statistical estimand, implementation of statistical estimators including parametric and semi-parametric methods, and interpretation of our findings. We believe that using such a framework in Data Science will help to ensure that our statistical analyses are guided by the scientific question driving our research, while avoiding over-interpreting our results. We focus on the effect of an exposure occurring at a single time point and highlight the use of targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner.},

  abstract = {The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis describes how early life environmental factors influence development in a way that impacts later health and disease risk. The hypothesis is supported by a large number of animal studies and a smaller number of observational studies in humans. Epigenetic variation induced in early life has emerged as a prime candidate to be the mediator of such effects, but little direct evidence of this relation exists in humans, primarily due to the inherent problems associated with unraveling the relative contributions of genetic and environmental variables to phenotypic diversity. There are several prerequisites for establishing a causal link that include demonstrating interindividual epigenetic variability in early life in response to specific environmental exposures. Further, compelling evidence linking epigenetic change to disease, prior to onset is required. Finally, the functional relevance of specific epigenetic change must be demonstrated. Evidence is emerging in all of these areas but, ultimately, only large longitudinal life-course studies, commencing prior to birth, can provide direct evidence in support of a role of epigenetic processes as a driver of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease in humans.},

Due to evidence of their estrogenic activity, they have been considered as chemicals of concern. The exposure of the Norwegian population to these compounds is presently unknown. Aims To measure urinary levels of twelve different environmental phenols including four emerging bisphenols: S, F, B and AF (abbreviated as BPS, BPF, BPB and BPAF, respectively) in a healthy Norwegian population. We have calculated short-term variability, estimated daily intakes and investigated important determinants of exposure. Methods Urine samples were collected from mothers (n\,=\,48) and their children (n\,=\,56) during spring/summer 2012 in two counties in Norway. Results Six environmental phenols namely methyl, ethyl and propyl paraben, BPA, BP-3 and TCS were detected in almost 100\% of the urine samples. Among the emerging bisphenols, BPS was detected most frequently in the urine samples (42–48\%) followed by BPF (4–15\%). Parabens were positively and significantly correlated to each other in both mothers and children. Levels of parabens and BP-3 were higher in mothers compared to children. All mothers and children had lower estimated daily intakes (back calculated from the urinary concentrations) of parabens and BPA than the respective acceptable and tolerable daily intakes (ADIs and TDIs) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Observed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated moderate to high reliability of spot urine measurements for all the environmental phenols (ICCs: 0.70–0.97). Use of hair products, deodorants, face and hand creams were significantly associated with higher urinary levels of parabens. Conclusions Occurrence of environmental phenols in healthy Norwegian women and children is abundant. Among emerging bisphenols, there is widespread exposure to BPS. A single spot urine sample can be used for estimating short-term exposures of environmental phenols. Urinary levels of parabens were associated with use of PCPs.},

  abstract = {Smoking prevalence is higher among individuals with schizophrenia or depression, and previous work has suggested this relationship is causal. However, this may be due to dynastic effects, for example reflecting maternal smoking during pregnancy rather than a direct effect of smoking. We used a proxy gene-by-environment Mendelian randomization approach to investigate whether there is a causal effect of maternal heaviness of smoking during pregnancy on offspring mental health.Analyses were performed in the UK Biobank cohort. Individuals with data on smoking status, maternal smoking during pregnancy, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or depression, and genetic data were included. We used participants’ genotype (rs16969968 in the CHRNA5 gene) as a proxy for their mothers’ genotype. Analyses were stratified on participants’ own smoking status in order to estimate the effect of maternal smoking heaviness during pregnancy independently of offspring smoking.The effect of maternal smoking on offspring schizophrenia was in opposing directions when stratifying on offspring smoking status. Among offspring of never smokers, each additional risk allele for maternal smoking heaviness appeared to have a protective effect [odds ratio (OR)\,=\,0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.95, P\,=\,0.015], whereas among ever smokers the effect of maternal smoking was in the reverse direction (OR\,=\,1.23, 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.45, P\,=\,0.011, Pinteraction\,\&lt;0.001). There was no clear evidence of an association between maternal smoking heaviness and offspring depression.These findings do not provide clear evidence of an effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring schizophrenia or depression, which implies that any causal effect of smoking on schizophrenia or depression is direct.},

Typical approaches utilize flexible regression models combined with variable selection to identify important exposures and estimate a potentially nonlinear relationship with the outcome of interest. Despite this surge in interest, no approaches to date can identify exposures and interactions while controlling any form of error rates with respect to exposure selection. We propose two novel approaches to estimating the health effects of environmental mixtures that simultaneously 1) Estimate and provide valid inference for the overall mixture effect, and 2) identify important exposures and interactions while controlling the false discovery rate. We show that this can lead to substantial power gains to detect weak effects of environmental exposures. We apply our approaches to a study of persistent organic pollutants and find that our approach is able to identify more interactions than existing approaches.},

The major concerns related to OP exposure are delayed effects following high level exposures as well as the impact of low level exposures during the lifespan which are suggested to be a risk factor for nervous system chronic diseases. Both high and low level exposures may have a particularly high impact in population subgroups such as aged or genetically vulnerable populations. Apart from the principle action of OPs which involves inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, several molecular targets, such as hormones; neurotransmitters; neurotrophic factors; enzymes related to the metabolism of beta amyloid protein as well as inflammatory changes have been identified for OP compounds. Here we review the main neurological and/or cognitive deficits described and the experimental and epidemiological relationships found between pesticide exposure and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) diseases. This report also focuses on possible individual differences making groups resilient or vulnerable to these toxicants. A critical discussion of the evidence obtained from experimental models and possible sources of bias in epidemiological studies is included. In particular this review aims to discuss common targets and pathways identified which may underlie the functional deficits associated with both pesticide exposure and neurodegeneration.},

  abstract = {Background Chronic exposure to certain metals plays a role in disease development. Integrating untargeted metabolomics with urinary metallome data may contribute to better understanding the pathophysiology of diseases and complex molecular interactions related to environmental metal exposures. To discover novel associations between urinary metal biomarkers and metabolism networks, we conducted an integrative metallome-metabolome analysis using a panel of urinary metals and untargeted blood metabolomic data from the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). Methods The SHFS is a prospective family-based cohort study comprised of American Indian men and women recruited in 2001–2003. This nested case-control analysis of 145 participants of which 50 developed incident diabetes at follow up in 2006–2009, included participants with urinary metal and untargeted metabolomic data. Concentrations of 8 creatinine-adjusted urine metals/metalloids [antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), tungsten (W), uranium (U) and zinc (Zn)], and 4 arsenic species [inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonate (MMA), dimethylarsinate (DMA), and arsenobetaine (AsB)] were measured. Global metabolomics was performed on plasma samples using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. We performed an integrative network analysis using xMWAS and a metabolic pathway analysis using Mummichog. Results 8,810 metabolic features and 12 metal species were included in the integrative network analysis. Most metal species were associated with distinct subsets of metabolites, forming single-metal-multiple-metabolite clusters (|r|{$>$}0.28, p-value 0.17, p-value {$<$} 0.1) showed effects in amino acid metabolism (AsB, Sb, Se and U), fatty acid and lipid metabolism (iAs, Mo, W, Sb, Pb, Cd and Zn). In stratified analyses among participants who went on to develop diabetes, iAs and U clustered together through shared metabolites, and both were associated with the phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism pathway; metals were also associated with metabolites in energy metabolism (iAs, MMA, DMA, U, W) and xenobiotic degradation and metabolism (DMA, Pb) pathways. Conclusion In this integrative analysis of multiple metals and untargeted metabolomics, results show common associations with fatty acid, energy and amino acid metabolism pathways. Results for individual metabolite associations differed for different metals, indicating that larger populations will be needed to confirm the metal–metal interactions detected here, such as the strong interaction of uranium and inorganic arsenic. Understanding the biochemical networks underlying metabolic homeostasis and their association with exposure to multiple metals may help identify novel biomarkers, pathways of disease, potential signatures of environmental metal exposure.},

  abstract = {Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biogenic monoamine acting as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), local mediator in the gut, and vasoactive agent in the blood. It has been linked to a variety of CNS functions and is implicated in many CNS and psychiatric disorders. The high comorbidity between some neuropathies can be partially understood by the fact that these diseases share a common etiology involving the serotoninergic system. In addition to its well-known functions, serotonin has been shown to be a mitogenic factor for a wide range of normal and tumor cells, including glioma cells, in vitro. The developing CNS of fetus and newborn is particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of neurotoxic substances in our environment, and perinatal exposure could result in the later development of diseases, a hypothesis known as the developmental origin of health and disease. Some of these substances affect the serotoninergic system and could therefore be the source of a silent pandemic of neurodevelopmental toxicity. This review presents the available data that are contributing to the appreciation of the effects of the exposome on the serotoninergic system and their potential link with brain pathologies (neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, neurobehavioral disorders, and glioblastoma).},

For example, patients on the liver transplant waiting list usually cannot be assigned a liver transplant immediately at the time they reach highest priority because a suitable organ is not immediately available. In settings with limited supply, investigators are often interested in the effects of treatment strategies in which a limited proportion of patients receive an organ at a given time, that is, treatment regimes satisfying resource constraints. Here, we describe an estimand that allows us to define causal effects of treatment strategies that satisfy resource constraints: incremental propensity score interventions (IPSIs) for limited resources. IPSIs flexibly constrain time-varying resource utilization through proportional scaling of patients' natural propensities for treatment, thereby preserving existing propensity rank ordering compared to the status quo. We derive a simple class of inverse-probability-weighted estimators, and we apply one such estimator to evaluate the effect of restricting or expanding utilization of "increased risk" liver organs to treat patients with end-stage liver~disease.},

While cross-sectional studies may be susceptible to reverse causality, may be limited to assessment of disease prevalence rather than incidence, or may only provide estimates of current rather than past exposures, not all cross-sectional studies suffer these limitations. Moreover, none of these concerns are unique to or inherent in the structure of a cross-sectional study. Regardless of when exposure and disease were ascertained relative to one another, a cross-sectional study may provide insights into the causal effects of exposure on disease incidence. Simply labeling a study as “cross-sectional” and assuming that 1 or more of these limitations exist and are materially important fails to recognize the need for a more nuanced assessment and risks discarding evidence that may be useful in assessing causal relationships.},

As statistically efficient and computationally fast alternative we propose a novel shrinkage covariance estimator that exploits the Ledoit-Wolf (2003) lemma for analytic calculation of the optimal shrinkage intensity.Subsequently, we apply this improved covariance estimator (which has guaranteed minimum mean squared error, is well-conditioned, and is always positive definite even for small sample sizes) to the problem of inferring large-scale gene association networks. We show that it performs very favorably compared to competing approaches both in simulations as well as in application to real expression data.},

  abstract = {Some studies indicate that Black women have higher exposure to multiple non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) than white women, but little is known about correlates of exposure to EDC mixtures. Using baseline data from a prospective cohort study of reproductive-aged Black women (N~=~751), we characterized profiles of EDC mixtures and identified correlates of exposure. At baseline, we quantified biomarkers of 16 phthalates, 7 phenols, 4 parabens, and triclocarban in urine and collected covariate data through self-administered questionnaires and interviews. We used principal component (PC) analysis and k-means clustering to describe EDC mixture profiles. Associations between correlates and PCs were estimated as the mean difference (β) in PC scores, while associations between correlates and cluster membership were estimated as the odds ratio (OR) of cluster membership. Personal care product use was consistently associated with profiles of higher biomarker concentrations of non-persistent EDCs. Use of nail polish, menstrual and vaginal products (e.g., vaginal powder, vaginal deodorant), and sunscreen was associated with a mixture of phthalate and some phenol biomarkers using both methods. Current vaginal ring use, a form of hormonal contraception placed inside the vagina, was strongly associated with higher concentrations of high molecular weight phthalate biomarkers (k-means clustering: OR~=~2.42, 95\% CI~=~1.28, 4.59; PCA: β~=~−0.32, 95\% CI~=~−0.71, 0.07). Several dietary, reproductive, and demographic correlates were also associated with mixtures of EDC biomarkers. These findings suggest that personal care product use, diet, and contraceptive use may be sources of exposure to multiple non-persistent EDCs among reproductive-aged Black women. Targeted interventions to reduce exposure to multiple EDCs among Black women are warranted.},

This term is meant to describe control (eg, by regression adjustment, stratification, or restriction) for a variable that either increases net bias or decreases precision without affecting bias. We define overadjustment bias as control for an intermediate variable (or a descending proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from exposure to outcome. We define unnecessary adjustment as control for a variable that does not affect bias of the causal relation between exposure and outcome but may affect its precision. We use causal diagrams and an empirical example (the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality) to illustrate and clarify the definition of overadjustment bias, and to distinguish overadjustment bias from unnecessary adjustment. Using simulations, we quantify the amount of bias associated with overadjustment. Moreover, we show that this bias is based on a different causal structure from confounding or selection biases. Overadjustment bias is not a finite sample bias, while inefficiencies due to control for unnecessary variables are a function of sample size.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveTraditional methods to deal with non-linearity in regression analysis often result in loss of information or compromised interpretability of the results. A recommended but underutilized method for modeling non-linear associations in regression models is spline functions. We explain spline functions in a non-mathematical way and illustrate the application and interpretation to an empirical data example.MethodsUsing data from the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study, we examined the non-linear relationship between the sum of four skinfolds and VO2max, which are measures of body fat and cardiorespiratory fitness, respectively. We compared traditional methods (i.e., quadratic regression and categorization) to spline methods [1- and 3-knot linear spline (LSP) models and a 3-knot restricted cubic spline (RCS) model] in terms of the interpretability of the results and their explained variance (radj2).ResultsThe spline models fitted the data better than the traditional methods. Increasing the number of knots in the LSP model increased the explained variance (from radj2=0.578 for the 1-knot model to radj2=0.582 for the 3-knot model). The RCS model fitted the data best (radj2=0.591), but results in regression coefficients that are harder to interpret.ConclusionSpline functions should be considered more often as they are flexible and can be applied in commonly used regression analysis. RCS regression is generally recommended for prediction research (i.e., to obtain the predicted outcome for a specific exposure value), whereas LSP regression is recommended if one is interested in the effects in a population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triclosan is a phenolic biocide used in a multitude of consumer products and in health care settings. It is widely detected in the American and Canadian populations and has been shown in animal models to act as an endocrine disrupting agent. However, there has been little examination to date of the effects of triclosan exposure in pregnancy on perinatal metabolic outcomes in human populations. METHODS: Using data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a Canadian pregnancy cohort, we measured associations of first-trimester urinary triclosan concentrations with total gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy, and fetal markers of metabolic function. Leptin and adiponectin were measured in plasma from umbilical cord blood samples in term neonates and categorized into low ({$<$} 10th percentile), intermediate (10th-90th percentile) and high ({$>$} 90th percentile) levels. Triclosan concentrations were grouped into quartiles and associations with study outcomes were examined using logistic regression models with adjustment for maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and urinary specific gravity. Restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to help assess linearity and shape of any dose-response relationships. All analyses for leptin and adiponectin levels were performed on the entire cohort as well as stratified by fetal sex. RESULTS: Triclosan measures were available for 1795 MIREC participants with a live born singleton birth. Regression analyses showed a non-significant inverse association between triclosan concentrations and leptin levels above the 90th percentile that was restricted to female fetuses (OR for highest quartile of triclosan compared to lowest quartile = 0.4 (95\% CI 0.2-1.1), p-value for trend across quartiles = 0.02). Triclosan concentrations in the second quartile were associated with elevated odds of adiponectin below the 10th percentile in male fetuses (OR for Q2 compared to Q1 = 2.5, 95\% CI 1.1-5.9, p-value for trend across quartiles = 0.93). No significant linear associations between triclosan concentrations and leptin or adiponectin levels in overall or sex-specific analyses were observed from restricted cubic spline analyses. No significant associations were observed in adjusted analyses between triclosan concentrations and gestational diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance or gestational weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support an association between triclosan concentrations in pregnancy and fetal metabolic markers, glucose disorders of pregnancy, or excessive gestational weight gain.},

We acknowledge that for some exposures this is likely to be correct, but argue that the focus on maternal pregnancy effects also reflects implicit and deeply-held assumptions that 1) causal early life exposures are primarily transmitted via maternal traits or exposures, 2) maternal exposures around the time of pregnancy and early infancy are particularly important, and 3) other factors, such as paternal factors and postnatal exposures in later life, have relatively little impact in comparison. These implicit assumptions about the “causal primacy” of maternal pregnancy effects set the agenda for DOHaD research and, through a looping effect, are reinforced rather than tested. We propose practical strategies to redress this imbalance through maintaining a critical perspective about these assumptions.},

In the process of attempting to do so, new bias may be introduced or a study may be rendered less generalizable. Therefore, the goals are to minimize bias and for both investigators and readers to comprehend its residual effects, limiting misinterpretation and misuse of data. Numerous forms of bias have been described, and the terminology can be confusing, overlapping, and specific to a medical specialty. Much of the terminology is drawn from the epidemiology literature and may not be common parlance for radiologists.

  abstract = {The epigenetic effects on DNA methylation, histone modification, and expression of non-coding RNAs (including microRNAs) of environmental chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates have expanded our understanding of the etiology of human complex diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Multiple lines of evidence from in vitro and in vivo models have established that epigenetic modifications caused by in utero exposure to environmental toxicants can induce alterations in gene expression that may persist throughout life. Epigenetics is an important mechanism in the ability of environmental chemicals to influence health and disease, and BPA and phthalates are epigenetically toxic. The epigenetic effect of BPA was clearly demonstrated in viable yellow mice by decreasing CpG methylation upstream of the Agouti gene, and the hypomethylating effect of BPA was prevented by maternal dietary supplementation with a methyl donor like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein. Histone H3 was found to be trimethylated at lysine 27 by BPA effect on EZH2 in a human breast cancer cell line and mice. BPA exposure of human placental cell lines has been shown to alter microRNA expression levels, and specifically, miR-146a was strongly induced by BPA treatment. In human breast cancer MCF7 cells, treatment with the phthalate BBP led to demethylation of estrogen receptor (ESR1) promoter-associated CpG islands, indicating that altered ESR1 mRNA expression by BBP is due to aberrant DNA methylation. Maternal exposure to phthalate DEHP was also shown to increase DNA methylation and expression levels of DNA methyltransferases in mouse testis. Further, some epigenetic effects of BPA and phthalates in female rats were found to be transgenerational. Finally, the available new technologies for global analysis of epigenetic alterations will provide insight into the extent and patterns of alterations between human normal and diseased tissues. In vitro models such as human embryonic stem cells may be extremely useful in bettering the understanding of epigenetic effects on human development, health and disease, because the formation of embryoid bodies in vitro is very similar to the early stage of embryogenesis.},

This link was initially observed between prenatal exposures and adult coronary heart disease, but corresponding observations have later been published for a range of chronic conditions. Although the hypothesis has been praised as an essential shift in our understanding of determinants for health, the hypothesis has also been criticized on a number of accounts, both methodologically and theoretically. The aim of this paper is to critically discuss the FOAD-hypothesis, in relation to the epidemiological evidence. We conclude that much of the research literature on the FOAD-hypothesis finds support for the hypothesis. Despite this, it is still unclear if the effects are independent and what the public health relevance is. Notwithstanding the heart of the hypothesis - that environmental influences during gestation have an effect on later development - should be considered a major insight and constitutes a complement to a focus on genetic and more proximal factors (such as adult lifestyle) as causes of adult disease. As the search for determinants for disease and health continues, the FOAD-hypothesis is likely to remain an important perspective. It may however be better positioned as part of a broader life course perspective, rather than as an independent hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Background Inflammation is associated with cognitive functioning and dementia in older adults, but whether inflammation is related to cognitive functioning in youth and whether these associations are causal remains unclear. Methods In a population-based cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; ALSPAC), we investigated cross-sectional associations of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], Interleukin-6 [IL-6] and Glycoprotein acetyls [GlycA]) with measures of cold (working memory, response inhibition) and hot (emotion recognition) cognition at age 24 (N~=~3,305 in multiple imputation models). Furthermore, we conducted one-sample and two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to examine potential causal effects of genetically-proxied inflammatory markers (CRP, GlycA, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, soluble IL-6 receptor) on cognitive measures (above) and on general cognitive ability. Results In the ALSPAC cohort, there was limited evidence of an association between standardised inflammatory markers and standardised cognitive measures at age 24 after adjusting for potential confounders (N~=~3,305; beta range, −0.02 [95~\% confidence interval (CI) −0.06 to 0.02, p~=~0.27] to 0.02 [95~\% CI −0.02 to 0.05, p~=~0.33]). Similarly, we found limited evidence of potential effects of 1-unit increase in genetically-proxied inflammatory markers on standardised working memory, emotion recognition or response inhibition in one-sample MR using ALSPAC data (beta range, −0.73 [95~\% CI −2.47 to 1.01, p~=~0.41] to 0.21 [95~\% CI −1.42 to 1.84, p~=~0.80]; or on standardised general cognitive ability in two-sample MR using the latest Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) datasets (inverse-variance weighted beta range, −0.02 [95~\% CI −0.05 to 0.01, p~=~0.12] to 0.03 [95~\% CI −0.01 to 0.07, p~=~0.19]). Conclusions Our MR findings do not provide strong evidence of a potential causal effect of inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, GlycA) on the cognitive functions examined here. Given the large confidence intervals in the one-sample MR, larger GWAS of specific cognitive measures are needed to enable well-powered MR analyses to investigate whether inflammation causally influences specific cognitive domains.},

  abstract = {Developmental exposure to organophosphates (OP) produces long-term changes in serotonin (5HT) synaptic function and associated behaviors, but there are disparities among the different OPs. We contrasted effects of chlorpyrifos and diazinon, as well as non-OP neurotoxicants (dieldrin, Ni2+) using undifferentiated and differentiating PC12 cells, a well-established neurodevelopmental model. Agents were introduced at 30~μM for 24 or 72~h, treatments devoid of cytotoxicity, and we evaluated the mRNAs encoding the proteins for 5HT biosynthesis, storage and degradation, as well as 5HT receptors. Chlorpyrifos and diazinon both induced tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for 5HT biosynthesis, but chlorpyrifos had a greater effect, and both agents suppressed expression of 5HT transporter genes, effects that would tend to augment extracellular 5HT. However, whereas chlorpyrifos enhanced the expression of most 5HT receptor subtypes, diazinon evoked overall suppression. Dieldrin evoked even stronger induction of tryptophan hydroxylase, and displayed a pattern of receptor effects similar to that of diazinon, even though they come from different pesticide classes. In contrast, Ni2+ had completely distinct actions, suppressing tryptophan hydroxylase and enhancing the vesicular monoamine transporter, while also reducing 5HT receptor gene expression, effects that would tend to lower net 5HT function. Our findings provide some of the first evidence connecting the direct, initial mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicant action on specific transmitter pathways with their long-term effects on synaptic function and behavior, while also providing support for in vitro test systems as tools for establishing mechanisms and outcomes of related and unrelated neurotoxicants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human exposure to parabens and other antimicrobial chemicals is continual and pervasive. The hormone-disrupting properties of these environmental chemicals may adversely affect human reproduction. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively assess couples' urinary concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals in the context of fecundity, measured as time to pregnancy (TTP). METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 501 couples, we examined preconception urinary chemical concentrations of parabens, triclosan and triclorcarban in relation to TTP; chemical concentrations were modeled both continuously and in quartiles. Cox's proportional odds models for discrete survival time were used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for a priori-defined confounders. In light of TTP being a couple-dependent outcome, both partner and couple-based exposure models were analyzed. In all models, FOR estimates {$<$} 1.0 denote diminished fecundity (longer TTP). RESULTS: Overall, 347 (69\%) couples became pregnant. The highest quartile of female urinary methyl paraben (MP) concentrations relative to the lowest reflected a 34\% reduction in fecundity (aFOR = 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.45, 0.97) and remained so when accounting for couples' concentrations (aFOR = 0.63; 95\% CI: 0.41, 0.96). Similar associations were observed between ethyl paraben (EP) and couple fecundity for both partner and couple-based models (p-trend = 0.02 and p-trend = 0.05, respectively). No associations were observed with couple fecundity when chemicals were modeled continuously. CONCLUSIONS: Higher quartiles of preconception urinary concentrations of MP and EP among female partners were associated with reduced couple fecundity in partner-specific and couple-based exposure models.},

A structured approach for selecting the hypotheses most supported by theory and observed data has been developed for binary exposures. The aim of this paper is to extend this to include continuous exposures and allow for confounding and missing data. METHODS: We studied two examples, the association between: (i) maternal weight during pregnancy and birthweight; and (ii) stressful family events throughout childhood and depression in adolescence. In each example we considered several plausible hypotheses including accumulation, critical periods, sensitive periods, change and effect modification. We used least angle regression to select the hypothesis that explained the most variation in the outcome, demonstrating appropriate methods for adjusting for confounders and dealing with missing data. RESULTS: The structured approach identified a combination of sensitive periods: pre-pregnancy weight, and gestational weight gain 0-20 weeks and 20-40 weeks, as the best explanation for variation in birthweight after adjusting for maternal height. A sensitive period hypothesis best explained variation in adolescent depression, with the association strengthening with the proximity of stressful family events. For each example, these models have theoretical support at least as strong as any competing hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have extended the structured approach to incorporate continuous exposures, confounding and missing data. This approach can be used in either an exploratory or a confirmatory setting. The interpretation, plausibility and consistency with causal assumptions should all be considered when proposing and choosing life course hypotheses.},

When different hypotheses for this effect are proposed by competing theories, it is important to identify those most supported by observed data as a first step toward estimating causal associations. One method is to compare goodness-of-fit of hypothesized models with a saturated model, but it is unclear how to judge the “best” out of two hypothesized models that both pass criteria for a good fit. We developed a new method using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to identify which of a small set of hypothesized models explains most of the observed outcome variation. We analyzed a cohort study with repeated measures of socioeconomic position (exposure) through childhood, early- and mid-adulthood, and body mass index (outcome) measured in mid-adulthood. We confirmed previous findings regarding support or lack of support for the following hypotheses: accumulation (number of times exposed), three critical periods (only exposure in childhood, early- or mid-adulthood), and social mobility (transition from low to high socioeconomic position). Simulations showed that our least absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach identified the most suitable hypothesized model with high probability in moderately sized samples, but with lower probability for hypotheses involving change in exposure or highly correlated exposures. Identifying a single, simple hypothesis that represents the specified knowledge of the life course association allows more precise definition of the causal effect of interest.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of many medical studies is to estimate the effects of a treatment or exposure on an outcome. However, it is not always possible to randomize the study participants to a particular treatment, therefore observational study designs may be used. There are major challenges with observational studies; one of which is confounding. Controlling for confounding is commonly performed by direct adjustment of measured confounders; although, sometimes this approach is suboptimal due to modeling assumptions and misspecification. Recent advances in the field of causal inference have dealt with confounding by building on classical standardization methods. However, these recent advances have progressed quickly with a relative paucity of computational-oriented applied tutorials contributing to some confusion in the use of these methods among applied researchers. In this tutorial, we show the computational implementation of different causal inference estimators from a historical perspective where new estimators were developed to overcome the limitations of the previous estimators (ie, nonparametric and parametric g-formula, inverse probability weighting, double-robust, and data-adaptive estimators). We illustrate the implementation of different methods using an empirical example from the Connors study based on intensive care medicine, and most importantly, we provide reproducible and commented code in Stata, R, and Python for researchers to adapt in their own observational study. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/migariane/Tutorial\_Computational\_Causal\_Inference\_Estimators.},

We focus on a class of parameters that have influence function which depends on two infinite dimensional nuisance functions and such that the bias of the one-step estimator of the parameter of interest is the expectation of the product of the estimation errors of the two nuisance functions. Our class includes many important treatment effect contrasts of interest in causal inference and econometrics, such as ATE, ATT, an integrated causal contrast with a continuous treatment, and the mean of an outcome missing not at random. We propose estimators of the target parameter that entertain approximately sparse regression models for the nuisance functions allowing for the number of potential confounders to be even larger than the sample size. By employing sample splitting, cross-fitting and \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-regularized regression estimators of the nuisance functions based on objective functions whose directional derivatives agree with those of the parameter's influence function, we obtain estimators of the target parameter with two desirable robustness properties: (1) they are rate doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when both nuisance functions follow approximately sparse models, even if one function has a very non-sparse regression coefficient, so long as the other has a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient, and (2) they are model doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal even if one of the nuisance functions does not follow an approximately sparse model so long as the other nuisance function follows an approximately sparse model with a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors and is often thought as an entry point into a negative life trajectory, including risk for comorbid disorders, poor educational achievement or low income. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the causal relationship between ADHD and a comprehensive range of related traits.We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for ADHD (n\,=\,53{$\mkern1mu$}293) and 124 traits related to anthropometry, cognitive function and intelligence, early life exposures, education and employment, lifestyle and environment, longevity, neurological, and psychiatric and mental health or personality and psychosocial factors available in the MR-Base database (16{$\mkern1mu$}067 ≤n\,≤766{$\mkern1mu$}345). To investigate their causal relationship with ADHD, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with a range of sensitivity analyses, and validated MR findings using causal analysis using summary effect estimates (CAUSE), aiming to avoid potential false-positive results.Our findings strengthen previous evidence of a causal effect of ADHD liability on smoking and major depression, and are consistent with a causal effect on odds of decreased average total household income [odds ratio (OR)\,=\,0.966, 95\% credible interval (CrI)\,=\,(0.954, 0.979)] and increased lifetime number of sexual partners [OR\,=\,1.023, 95\% CrI\,=\,(1.013, 1.033)].

  abstract = {When addressing environmental health-related questions, most often, only observational data are collected for ethical or practical reasons. However, the lack of randomized exposure often prevents the comparison of similar groups of exposed and unexposed units. This design barrier leads the environmental epidemiology field to mainly estimate associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes. A recently developed causal inference pipeline was developed to guide researchers interested in estimating the effects of plausible hypothetical interventions for policy recommendations. This article illustrates how this multistaged pipeline can help environmental epidemiologists reconstruct and analyze hypothetical randomized experiments by investigating whether an air pollution reduction intervention decreases the risk of multiple sclerosis relapses in Alsace region, France. The epidemiology literature reports conflicted findings on the relationship between air pollution and multiple sclerosis. Some studies found significant associations, whereas others did not. Two case-crossover studies reported significant associations between the risk of multiple sclerosis relapses and the exposure to air pollutants in the Alsace region. We use the same study population as these epidemiological studies to illustrate how appealing this causal inference approach is to estimate the effects of hypothetical, but plausible, environmental interventions.},

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association between maternal urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites between the 24th and 28th week of gestation and occurrence of eczema in their sons up to 5 y of age, according to allergic sensitization as assessed by total immunoglobulin E (IgE) in a subsample of individuals. METHODS: Data on health outcomes and background factors were collected using five standardized annual questionnaires completed by parents at the children's ages of 1-5 y, and their associations with phthalate metabolite urinary concentrations were assessed in 604 mother-son pairs with adjusted multiple logistic regression and Cox's survival model. Several eczema phenotypes were considered. Atopic status was assessed at 5 y of age in 293 boys through total IgE assessment. RESULTS: At 5 y of age, the prevalence of ever eczema was 30.4\%. Metabolites of di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP) and di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) were positively associated with early-onset (0-24 mo of age) eczema (15.7\%) and late-onset (24-60 mo of age) eczema (14.7\%). Applying the Cox's model showed a significant association of occurrence of eczema in the first 5 y of life with DiBP and DiNP metabolites. Among IgE-sensitized boys, metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and DiBP were significantly associated with ever eczema \{hazard ratio (HR)=1.67 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 2.54], p=0.01 and HR=1.87 (95\% CI: 1.01, 3.48), p=0.04, respectively\}. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of eczema in early childhood may be influenced by prenatal exposure to certain phthalates in boys. Further investigations are needed to confirm this observation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1829.},

Triclosan and paraben exposure may be associated with allergy (atopy), but these associations have not been evaluated with respect to other atopic states such as eczema (atopic dermatitis). This study examines the associations of urinary triclosan and paraben concentrations with allergic sensitization and asthma in children according to eczema history. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of U.S. children aged 6‐18 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005‐2006). Triclosan and paraben concentrations were measured in urine. We assessed associations of triclosan and parabens with allergic sensitization and asthma using multivariable logistic regression in 837 children with complete data and stratified our results by eczema status. After covariate adjustment, triclosan and methyl and propyl paraben concentrations were positively associated with the odds of aeroallergen sensitization. Eczema did not significantly modify the association between triclosan or paraben levels and aeroallergen sensitization, asthma, or wheeze. The odds of parent-reported atopic asthma increased 34\% (95\% CI, 0, 81) across triclosan concentration quartiles. Increasing triclosan concentrations (quartiles) were associated with 2.3 times the odds of food sensitization (95\% CI, 1.14, 4.44) among children with eczema, but not among children without eczema (OR, 1.25; 95\% CI 0.93, 1.68; effect measure modification, p = 0.04). Triclosan and paraben exposures may increase the risk of atopic asthma and aeroallergen sensitization. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings and determine if these chemicals pose a risk to children's health.},

Low testosterone in adult human males has been associated with increased prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. OBJECTIVES: Our objective in this study was to investigate phthalate exposure and its associations with abdominal obesity and insulin resistance. METHODS: Subjects were adult U.S. male participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. We modeled six phthalate metabolites with prevalent exposure and known or suspected antiandrogenic activity as predictors of waist circumference and log-transformed homeostatic model assessment (HOMA; a measure of insulin resistance) using multiple linear regression, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, fat and total calorie consumption, physical activity level, serum cotinine, and urine creatinine (model 1); and adjusted for model 1 covariates plus measures of renal and hepatic function (model 2). Metabolites were mono-butyl phthalates (MBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP). RESULTS: In model 1, four metabolites were associated with increased waist circumference (MBzP, MEHHP, MEOHP, and MEP; p-values},

The course we have developed follows the story of how we use data to understand the world, leveraging simulation-based approaches to perform customized analyses and evaluate the behavior of statistical procedures. We provide ideas for expanding beyond the traditional classroom, two example activities, and a course syllabus as well as the set of statistical best practices for creating and consuming scientific information that we develop during the course.},

However, the reliability of each of these measurements is not equal, and little consideration is paid to consequences for research. We correlated repeat measurements of the same DNA samples using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K and the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips in 350 blood DNA samples. Probes that were reliably measured were more heritable and showed consistent associations with environmental exposures, gene expression, and greater cross-tissue concordance. Unreliable probes were less replicable and generated an unknown volume of false negatives. This serves as a lesson for working with DNA methylation data, but the lessons are equally applicable to working with other data: as we advance toward generating increasingly greater volumes of data, failure to document reliability risks harming reproducibility.},

We identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood metabolite concentrations, of which 25 show effect sizes that are unusually high for GWAS and account for 10–60\% differences in metabolite levels per allele copy. Our associations provide new functional insights for many disease-related associations that have been reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism and Crohn’s disease.

  abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identify genes that are dysregulated by the studied clinical endpoints, thereby indicating potential new diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets and therapy options. Combining EWAS with deep molecular phenotyping, such as approaches enabled by metabolomics and proteomics, allows further probing of the underlying disease-associated pathways. For instance, methylation of the TXNIP gene is associated robustly with prevalent type 2 diabetes and further with metabolites that are short-term markers of glycaemic control. These associations reflect TXNIP’s function as a glucose uptake regulator by interaction with the major glucose transporter GLUT1 and suggest that TXNIP methylation can be used as a read-out for the organism’s exposure to glucose stress. Another case is the association between DNA methylation of the AHRR and F2RL3 genes with smoking and a protein that is involved in the reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium. These examples show that associations between DNA methylation and intermediate molecular traits can open new windows into how the body copes with physiological challenges. This knowledge, if carefully interpreted, may indicate novel therapy options and, together with monitoring of the methylation state of specific methylation sites, may in the future allow the early diagnosis of impending disease. It is essential for medical practitioners to recognize the potential that this field holds in translating basic research findings to clinical practice. In this review, we present recent advances in the field of EWAS with metabolomics and proteomics and discuss both the potential and the challenges of translating epigenetic associations, with deep molecular phenotypes, to biomedical applications.},

However, the association with coronary heart disease (CHD) is still unclear. A total of 180 subjects randomly selected from 336 CHD patients, and 360 age- and sex-matched non-CHD controls were included from 2008 to 2011. Urinary metabolites of phthalate esters were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The geometric means of urinary phthalates metabolites were significantly higher for the three Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate among CHD patients in-hospital than those of being discharged. Excluding 89 CHD patients of in-hospital and hospital discharge within 2 days, we found the urinary concentrations of MEHP, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) of 91 CHD patients discharged ≥\,3 days were higher than those of controls. Among 451 participants, those with higher tertile levels of urinary MEHP, MnBP, and MiBP showed an increased risk for CHD compared to those with lowest tertile levels; the corresponding odds ratios (95\% CI) were 2.77 (1.22-6.28), 2.90 (1.32-6.4), and 3.19 (1.41-7.21), respectively, after adjustment for confounders. Higher levels of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were linked with increased levels of all DEHP metabolites in CHD patients. In conclusion, exposure to DEHP and dibutyl phthalates was positively associated with CHD and this relationship may be probably mediated via atherothrombosis.},

  abstract = {Humans are exposed to an ever-increasing number of environmental toxicants, some of which have gradually been elucidated to be important risk factors for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management.},

  abstract = {Background It has been widely recognized that a critical time window for neurodevelopment occurs in early life and the host's gut microbiome plays an important role in neurodevelopment. Following recent demonstrations that the maternal prenatal gut microbiome influences offspring brain development in murine models, we aim to explore whether the critical time window for the association between the gut microbiome and neurodevelopment is prenatal or postnatal for human. Methods Here we leverage a large-scale human study and compare the associations between the gut microbiota and metabolites from mothers during pregnancy and their children with the children's neurodevelopment. Specifically, using multinomial regression integrated in Songbird, we assessed the discriminating power of the maternal prenatal and child gut microbiome for children's neurodevelopment at early life as measured by the Ages \& Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). Findings We show that the maternal prenatal gut microbiome is more relevant than the children's gut microbiome to the children's neurodevelopment in the first year of life (maximum Q2~=~0.212 and 0.096 separately using the taxa at the class level). Moreover, we found that Fusobacteriia is more associated with high fine motor skills in ASQ in the maternal prenatal gut microbiota but become more associated with low fine motor skills in the infant gut microbiota (rank~=~0.084 and~−0.047 separately), suggesting the roles of the same taxa with respect to neurodevelopment can be opposite at the two stages of fetal neurodevelopment. Interpretation These findings shed light, especially in terms of timing, on potential therapeutic interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders.

  abstract = {The use of bivariable selection (BVS) for selecting variables to be used in multivariable analysis is inappropriate despite its common usage in medical sciences. In BVS, if the statistical p value of a risk factor in bivariable analysis is greater than an arbitrary value (often p = 0.05), then this factor will not be allowed to compete for inclusion in multivariable analysis. This type of variable selection is inappropriate because the BVS method wrongly rejects potentially important variables when the relationship between an outcome and a risk factor is confounded by any confounder and when this confounder is not properly controlled. This article uses both hypothetical and actual data to show how a nonsignificant risk factor in bivariable analysis may actually be a significant risk factor in multivariable analysis if confounding is properly controlled. Furthermore, problems resulting from the automated forward and stepwise modeling with or without the presence of confounding are also addressed. To avoid these improper procedures and deficiencies, alternatives in performing multivariable analysis, including advantages and disadvantages of the BVS method and automated stepwise modeling, are reviewed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Background Air pollution is a suspected developmental neurotoxicant. Many schools are located in close proximity to busy roads, and traffic air pollution peaks when children are at school. We aimed to assess whether exposure of children in primary school to traffic-related air pollutants is associated with impaired cognitive development. Methods and Findings We conducted a prospective study of children (n = 2,715, aged 7 to 10 y) from 39 schools in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) exposed to high and low traffic-related air pollution, paired by school socioeconomic index; children were tested four times (i.e., to assess the 12-mo developmental trajectories) via computerized tests (n = 10,112). Chronic traffic air pollution (elemental carbon [EC], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and ultrafine particle number [UFP; 10–700 nm]) was measured twice during 1-wk campaigns both in the courtyard (outdoor) and inside the classroom (indoor) simultaneously in each school pair. Cognitive development was assessed with the n-back and the attentional network tests, in particular, working memory (two-back detectability), superior working memory (three-back detectability), and inattentiveness (hit reaction time standard error). Linear mixed effects models were adjusted for age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic status, and air pollution exposure at home. Children from highly polluted schools had a smaller growth in cognitive development than children from the paired lowly polluted schools, both in crude and adjusted models (e.g., 7.4\% [95\% CI 5.6\%–8.8\%] versus 11.5\% [95\% CI 8.9\%–12.5\%] improvement in working memory, p = 0.0024). Cogently, children attending schools with higher levels of EC, NO2, and UFP both indoors and outdoors experienced substantially smaller growth in all the cognitive measurements; for example, a change from the first to the fourth quartile in indoor EC reduced the gain in working memory by 13.0\% (95\% CI 4.2\%–23.1\%). Residual confounding for social class could not be discarded completely; however, the associations remained in stratified analyses (e.g., for type of school or high-/low-polluted area) and after additional adjustments (e.g., for commuting, educational quality, or smoking at home), contradicting a potential residual confounding explanation. Conclusions Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.},

We aim to examine the association between daily variation in traffic-related air pollution and attention.         Methods:~         We conducted a follow-up study from January 2012 to March 2013 in 2,687 school children from 265 classrooms in 39 schools in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). We assessed four domains of children’s attention processes every 3 months over four repeated visits providing a total of 10,002 computerized tests on 177 different days using the child Attention Network test (ANT). Ambient daily levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and elemental carbon (EC) in particulate matter {$<$}2.5 µm (PM2.5) filters were measured at a fixed air quality background monitoring station and in schools.         Results:~         Daily ambient levels of both NO2 and EC were negatively associated with all attention processes (e.g., children in the bottom quartile of daily exposure to ambient NO2 levels had a 14.8 msecond [95\% confidence interval, 11.2, 18.4] faster response time than those in the top quartile, which was equivalent to a 1.1-month [0.84, 1.37] retardation in the natural developmental improvement in response speed with age). Similar findings were observed after adjusting for the average indoor (classroom) levels of pollutants. Associations for EC were similar to those for NO2 and robust to several sensitivity analyses.         Conclusions:~         The short-term association of traffic-related air pollutants with fluctuations in attention adds to the evidence that air pollution may have potential harmful effects on neurodevelopment.

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are visual representations of causal assumptions that are increasingly used in modern epidemiology. They can help to identify the presence of confounding for the causal question at hand. This structured approach serves as a visual aid in the scientific discussion by making underlying relations explicit. This article explains the basic concepts of DAGs and provides examples in the field of nephrology with and without presence of confounding. Ultimately, these examples will show that DAGs can be preferable to the traditional methods to identify sources of confounding, especially in complex research questions.},

Information on these interactions is dispersed over many databases, texts and prediction methods, which makes it difficult to get a comprehensive overview of the available evidence. To address this, we have developed STITCH ('Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals') that integrates these disparate data sources for 430 000 chemicals into a single, easy-to-use resource. In addition to the increased scope of the database, we have implemented a new network view that gives the user the ability to view binding affinities of chemicals in the interaction network. This enables the user to get a quick overview of the potential effects of the chemical on its interaction partners. For each organism, STITCH provides a global network; however, not all proteins have the same pattern of spatial expression. Therefore, only a certain subset of interactions can occur simultaneously. In the new, fifth release of STITCH, we have implemented functionality to filter out the proteins and chemicals not associated with a given tissue. The STITCH database can be downloaded in full, accessed programmatically via an extensive API, or searched via a redesigned web interface at http://stitch.embl.de.},

Genetic mutations alone only explain\,{$<$}10\% of PD cases, while environmental factors, including small molecules, may play a significant role in PD. In the present work, 22 plasma (11 PD, 11 control) and 19 feces samples (10 PD, 9 control) were analyzed by non-target high-resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) coupled to two liquid chromatography (LC) methods (reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)). A cheminformatics workflow was optimized using open software (MS-DIAL and patRoon) and open databases (all public MSP-formatted spectral libraries for MS-DIAL, PubChemLite for Exposomics, and the LITMINEDNEURO list for patRoon). Furthermore, five disease-specific databases and three suspect lists (on PD and related disorders) were developed, using PubChem functionality to identifying relevant unknown chemicals. The results showed that non-target screening with the larger databases generally provided better results compared with smaller suspect lists. However, two suspect screening approaches with patRoon were also good options to study specific chemicals in PD. The combination of chromatographic methods (RP and HILIC) as well as two ionization modes (positive and negative) enhanced the coverage of chemicals in the biological samples. While most metabolomics studies in PD have focused on blood and cerebrospinal fluid, we found a higher number of relevant features in feces, such as alanine betaine or nicotinamide, which can be directly metabolized by gut microbiota. This highlights the potential role of gut dysbiosis in PD development.},

Here, we briefly summarize the rationale for studying multiple exposures, also called mixture, in relation to child health and key statistical approaches that can be used. We discuss advantages over traditional methods, limitations and appropriateness of the context. RECENT FINDINGS: New approaches allow pediatric researchers to answer increasingly complex questions related to environmental mixtures. We present methods to identify the most relevant exposures among a high-multitude of variables, via shrinkage and variable selection techniques, and identify the overall mixture effect, via Weighted Quantile Sum and Bayesian Kernel Machine regressions. We then describe novel extensions that handle high-dimensional exposure data and allow identification of critical exposure windows. SUMMARY: Recent advances in statistics and machine learning enable researchers to identify important mixture components, estimate joint mixture effects and pinpoint critical windows of exposure. Despite many advantages over single chemical approaches, measurement error and biases may be amplified in mixtures research, requiring careful study planning and design. Future research requires increased collaboration between epidemiologists, statisticians and data scientists, and further integration with causal inference methods.},

One common theme appears to be the effect of SBSN on tumor progression, such as invasion, metastasis and resistance. However, the function and mechanism of action of SBSN is still elusive. In this study, we reviewed the literature on SBSN in the PubMed database to identify the basic characteristics, biological functions, and roles of SBSN in cancer and other diseases. In particular, we focused on the potential mechanisms of SBSN activity, to improve our understanding of the complex function of this protein and provide a theoretical basis for further research on the role of SBSN in cancer and other diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: It is plausible that maternal pregnancy metabolism influences the risk of offspring congenital heart disease (CHD). We sought to explore this through a systematic approach using different methods and data. Methods: We undertook multivariable logistic regression of the odds of CHD for 923 mass spectrometry (MS)-derived metabolites in a sub-sample of a UK birth cohort (Born in Bradford (BiB); N = 2605, 46 CHD cases). We considered metabolites reaching a p-value threshold {$<$}0.05 to be suggestively associated with CHD. We sought validation of our findings, by repeating the multivariable regression analysis within the BiB cohort for any suggestively associated metabolite that was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or clinical chemistry (N = 7296, 87 CHD cases), and by using genetic risk scores (GRS: weighted genetic risk scores of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with any suggestive metabolite) in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. The MR analyses were performed in BiB and two additional European birth cohorts (N = 38,662, 319 CHD cases). Results: In the main multivariable analyses, we identified 44 metabolites suggestively associated with CHD, including those from the following super pathways: amino acids, lipids, co-factors and vitamins, xenobiotics, nucleotides, energy, and several unknown molecules. Of these 44, isoleucine and leucine were available in the larger BiB cohort (NMR), and for these the results were validated. The MR analyses were possible for 27/44 metabolites and for 11 there was consistency with the multivariable regression results. Conclusions: In summary, we have used complimentary data sources and statistical techniques to construct layers of evidence. We found that pregnancy amino acid metabolism, androgenic steroid lipids, and levels of succinylcarnitine could be important contributing factors for CHD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In longitudinal data, it is common to create 'change scores' by subtracting measurements taken at baseline from those taken at follow-up, and then to analyse the resulting 'change' as the outcome variable. In observational data, this approach can produce misleading causal-effect estimates. The present article uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simple simulations to provide an accessible explanation for why change scores do not estimate causal effects in observational data. METHODS: Data were simulated to match three general scenarios in which the outcome variable at baseline was a (i) 'competing exposure' (i.e. a cause of the outcome that is neither caused by nor causes the exposure), (ii) confounder or (iii) mediator for the total causal effect of the exposure variable at baseline on the outcome variable at follow-up. Regression coefficients were compared between change-score analyses and the appropriate estimator(s) for the total and/or direct causal effect(s). RESULTS: Change-score analyses do not provide meaningful causal-effect estimates unless the baseline outcome variable is a 'competing exposure' for the effect of the exposure on the outcome at follow-up. Where the baseline outcome is a confounder or mediator, change-score analyses evaluate obscure estimands, which may diverge substantially in magnitude and direction from the total and direct causal effects. CONCLUSION: Future observational studies that seek causal-effect estimates should avoid analysing change scores and adopt alternative analytical strategies.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that require conditioning when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research.Original health research articles published during 1999–2017 mentioning ‘directed acyclic graphs’ (or similar) or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article’s largest DAG.A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n\,=\,48, 21\%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n\,=\,115, 48\%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n\,=\,144, 62\%) made at least one DAG available. DAGs varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range (IQR): 9–16, range: 3–28] and 29 arcs (IQR: 19–42, range: 3–99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46\% (IQR: 31–67, range: 12–100). 37\% (n\,=\,53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17\% (n\,=\,25) included ‘super-nodes’ (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34\% (n\,=\,49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom).There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlights some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.},

DAGitty is a popular web application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the R package 'dagitty', which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package 'dagitty' can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate 'statistically equivalent' but causally different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R package 'dagitty' is available through the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source code is available on github at [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty].

However, while human-derived metabolites such as lipids and oligosaccharides in human milk are regularly reported, the presence of exogenous chemicals (such as drugs, food, and synthetic compounds) are often not addressed. To understand the types of exogenous compounds that might be present, human milk (n=996) was analyzed by untargeted metabolomics. This analysis revealed that lifestyle molecules such as medications and their metabolites, food, industrial sources such as plasticizers, cosmetics, microbial molecules, and other personal care products are found in human milk. We provide further evidence that some of these lifestyle molecules are also detectable in the newborn’s stool. Thus, this study gives important insight into the types of exposures infants receiving human milk might ingest due to the lifestyle choices, exposure, or medical status of the lactating parent.},

  abstract = {Benzene, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, through transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we reported dose-dependent effects of benzene exposure on gene expression and biochemical pathways in 83 workers exposed across four airborne concentration ranges (from {$<$}1 ppm to {$>$}10 ppm) compared with 42 subjects with non-workplace ambient exposure levels. Here, we further characterize these dose-dependent effects with continuous benzene exposure in all 125 study subjects. We estimated air benzene exposure levels in the 42 environmentally-exposed subjects from their unmetabolized urinary benzene levels. We used a novel non-parametric, data-adaptive model selection method to estimate the change with dose in the expression of each gene. We describe non-parametric approaches to model pathway responses and used these to estimate the dose responses of the AML pathway and 4 other pathways of interest. The response patterns of majority of genes as captured by mean estimates of the first and second principal components of the dose-response for the five pathways and the profiles of 6 AML pathway response-representative genes (identified by clustering) exhibited similar apparent supra-linear responses. Responses at or below 0.1 ppm benzene were observed for altered expression of AML pathway genes and CYP2E1. Together, these data show that benzene alters disease-relevant pathways and genes in a dose-dependent manner, with effects apparent at doses as low as 100 ppb in air. Studies with extensive exposure assessment of subjects exposed in the low-dose range between 10 ppb and 1 ppm are needed to confirm these findings.},

In many scientific disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal effects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally affects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is frequently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice. Finally, the package also offers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized trials.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Several studies have confirmed associations between air pollution and overall mortality, but it is unclear to what extent these associations reflect causal relationships. Moreover, few studies to our knowledge have accounted for complex mixtures of air pollution. In this paper, we evaluate causal effects of a mixture of air pollutants on overall mortality in a large, prospective cohort of Dutch individuals.         Methods:~         We evaluated 86,882 individuals from the LIFEWORK study, assessing overall mortality between 2013-2017 through national registry linkage. We predicted outdoor concentration of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, PM2.5 absorbance, oxidative potential) with land-use regression. We used logistic regression and mixture modeling (weighted quantile sum and boosted regression tree models) to identify potential confounders, assess pollutants relevance in the mixture–outcome association, and investigate interactions and non-linearities. Based on these results, we built a multivariate generalized propensity score model to estimate causal effects of pollutant mixtures.         Results:~         Regression model results were influenced by multicollinearity. Weighted quantile sum and boosted regression tree models indicated that all components contributed to a positive linear association with the outcome, with PM2.5 being the most relevant contributor. In the multivariate propensity score model, PM2.5 (OR=1.18, 95\% CI:1.08,1.29) and PM10 (OR=1.02, 95\% CI:0.91,1.14) were associated with increased odds of mortality per interquartile range increase.         Conclusion:~         Using novel methods for causal inference and mixture modeling in a large prospective cohort, this study strengthened the causal interpretation of air pollution effects on overall mortality, emphasizing the primary role of PM2.5 within the pollutant mixture.},

The most commonly used methods for testing the difference in treatment efficacy are the two-sample t-test and the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). It has been suggested that ancova should be used in the analysis of change for data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a result of its greater statistical power. However, it is less well known that although both methods will give rise to similar results in the analysis of change for RCTs, there are different assumptions behind these methods in terms of the relationship between baseline value and the subsequent change, and the results may therefore differ if baseline values are not balanced between groups. This article uses structural equation modelling as a conceptual framework to explain the assumptions behind these methods, and two examples are used to show when the two methods yield similar results and why, in some non-randomized studies, the two methods might give substantially different results, known as 'Lord's paradox' in the statistical literature. For the appropriate interpretation of non-randomized studies, the assumptions underlying these methods therefore need to be taken into consideration.},

However, little attention has been paid to these concerns in medical and dental research. The use of ratio variables in correlation and regression analysis can give rise to spurious results due to inappropriate model specification and mathematical coupling, leading to serious misinterpretation of data and consequently to incorrect study conclusions. METHODS: Data were reanalysed from two recently published articles: one on the efficacy of guided tissue regeneration on root coverage; the other a randomised controlled trial comparing three surgical approaches in the treatment of periodontal infrabony defects. The reanalysis was performed to examine whether the assumptions behind the correlation/regression analyses have been seriously violated in these two studies, and to see if the interpretation of results is tenable. RESULTS: Use of ratio variables seriously violated the assumptions underpinning the statistical methods utilised in these two studies, and consequently the conclusions were substantially misleading. Recommendations made in these studies were not tenable. CONCLUSIONS: The reanalyses illustrate how the inappropriate use of ratio variables remains prevalent in dental research, leading to incorrect interpretation of the evidence. This emphasises the need for collaboration between clinicians and statisticians to avoid the risk of yielding erroneous conclusions from flawed statistical analyses.},

For example, there is evidence that people who developed coronary heart disease and diabetes experienced different growth trajectories from those who did not develop these diseases. However, some of the methods used in these articles may have been flawed. We critically evaluate proposed approaches for identifying the growth trajectories distinctive to those developing later disease and identifying critical phases of growth during the early lifecourse. Among the approaches we examined (tracing the z-scores, lifecourse plots and models, lifecourse path analysis, conditional body size analysis, multilevel analysis, latent growth curve models and growth mixture models) conditional body size analysis, multilevel analysis, latent growth curve models and growth mixture models are least prone to collinearity problems caused by repeated measures. Multilevel analysis is more flexible when body size is not measured at the same age for all cohort members. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach are illustrated using real data. Demonstrating the influence of growth trajectories on later disease is complex and challenging; therefore, it is likely that a combination of approaches will be required to unravel the complexity in lifecourse research.},

Computer simulations were conducted for three hypothetical relations between birth weight and adult blood pressure. The authors examined the effect of statistically adjusting for different correlations between current weight and birth weight and between current weight and adult blood pressure to assess their impact on associations between birth weight and blood pressure. When there was no genuine relation between birth weight and blood pressure, adjustment for current weight created an inverse association whose size depended on the magnitude of the positive correlations between current weight and birth weight and between current weight and blood pressure. When there was a genuine inverse relation between birth weight and blood pressure, the association was exaggerated following adjustment for current weight, whereas a positive relation between birth weight and blood pressure could be reversed after adjusting for current weight. Thus, researchers must consider the reversal paradox when adjusting for variables that lie within causal pathways.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Recent studies have found that postnatal catch-up growth might have a stronger impact than birth size on health in later life. Because growth is a continuing process, the challenge is to tease out the impact of body size at different critical phases. Ordinary least squares regression cannot differentiate the effects of birth size, growth, and current body size simultaneously, because growth is generally defined as the difference between birth size and current size, giving rise to perfect collinearity.           Methods:~           This paper aims to describe and justify the use of a novel approach, partial least squares, to estimate life course effects of body size z-scores on later blood pressure, using longitudinal data from a cohort of 960 Filipino boys. Body weight z-scores and changes in z-score weight were measured from birth to age 19 years, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) were measured at age 19.           Results:~           In general, birth size had a very modest association with systolic BP. The early changes in z-scores between birth and the age of 2 years were positively associated with the outcome. Growth after age 8 had a larger effect than early growth, but the confidence intervals are generally large. For diastolic BP, the association was similar for early and later growth. Current body size had the strongest relationships with both outcomes.           Conclusion:~           By creating weighted composites of perfectly collinear variables as components, partial least squares estimates the life course effects of body size on later health according to the correlations between body size and health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), such as phthalates and phenols, during pregnancy may be associated with excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), an important predictor of future health of the mother and the offspring. There is however a paucity of literature examining this association, and no study has accounted for the complex nature of EDCs exposure as a time-varying mixture of chemicals. Objective We examined the association between trimester-specific EDCs mixture and GWG in pregnant women attending a fertility clinic, to identify windows of susceptibility to such exposures, and assess the individual contribution of each chemical over pregnancy. Methods We included 243 pregnant women from the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study, who provided up to 3 urine samples (one per trimester), and with available data on GWG. Urinary concentrations of 7 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, and 2 parabens, corrected for specific gravity, were included in the analysis. The association between trimester-specific EDCs mixture and GWG was evaluated using multiple regression models – categorizing exposures into concentration quartiles– and with Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), while adjusting for potential confounders. Hierarchical BKMR (hBKMR) was used to account for the time-varying nature of chemical concentrations over pregnancy, identifying the most important trimester and most important EDC within each trimester. Results During 1st trimester, higher GWG was observed at higher sum of metabolites of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHP) from both multiple regression (e.g. comparing the 4th quartile with the 1st: β~=~2.36~kg, 95\% CI: 0.47, 5.19) and BKMR. During 2nd and 3rd trimesters, positive associations with mono-n-butyl phthalate and propylparaben, and negative with ΣDEHP and methylparaben were observed. When evaluating exposures as a time-varying mixture with hBKMR, 1st trimester was the most important exposure window when evaluating prenatal urinary EDCs in relation to GWG. Within the 1st trimester, urinary ΣDEHP, mono-isobutyl phthalate and propylparaben had the highest contribution in the positive association between the mixture and GWG. Conclusion We observed positive associations between urinary EDCs during pregnancy, especially DEHP metabolites, and GWG. Our results suggest the 1st trimester of pregnancy as the time window of highest susceptibility to the effects of EDCs on GWG, with potential indication for the design of public health interventions, informing prevention strategies for reducing sources of exposure at specific time points.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to chemical mixtures is recognized as the real-life scenario in all populations, needing new statistical methods that can assess their complex effects. Objectives: We aimed to assess the joint effect of in utero exposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on children’s neurodevelopment. Methods: We employed a novel statistical approach, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), to study the joint effect of coexposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on neurodevelopment using an adapted Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development™. Third Edition, in 825 mother–child pairs recruited into a prospective birth cohort from two clinics in the Pabna and Sirajdikhan districts of Bangladesh. Metals were measured in cord blood using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results: Analyses were stratified by clinic due to differences in exposure profiles. In the Pabna district, which displayed high manganese levels [interquartile range (IQR): 4.8,  18μg/dl 18 μ g / dl ], we found a statistically significant negative effect of the mixture of arsenic, lead, and manganese on cognitive score when cord blood metals concentrations were all above the 60th percentile ( As≥0.7μg/dl As ≥ 0.7 μ g / dl ,  Mn≥6.6μg/dl Mn ≥ 6.6 μ g / dl ,  Pb≥4.2μg/dl Pb ≥ 4.2 μ g / dl ) compared to the median ( As=0.5μg/dl As = 0.5 μ g / dl ,  Mn=5.8μg/dl Mn = 5.8 μ g / dl ,  Pb=3.1μg/dl Pb = 3.1 μ g / dl ). Evidence of a nonlinear effect of manganese was found. A change in log manganese from the 25th to the 75th percentile when arsenic and manganese were at the median was associated with a decrease in cognitive score of  −0.3 − 0.3  ( −0.5 − 0.5 ,  −0.1 − 0.1 ) standard deviations. Our study suggests that arsenic might be a potentiator of manganese toxicity. Conclusions: Employing a novel statistical method for the study of the health effects of chemical mixtures, we found evidence of neurotoxicity of the mixture, as well as potential synergism between arsenic and manganese. https://doi-org.sare.upf.edu/10.1289/EHP614},

  abstract = {When developing risk prediction models, shrinkage methods are recommended, especially when the sample size is limited. Several earlier studies have shown that the shrinkage of model coefficients can reduce overfitting of the prediction model and subsequently result in better predictive performance on average. In this simulation study, we aimed to investigate the variability of regression shrinkage on predictive performance for a binary outcome, with focus on the calibration slope. The slope indicates whether risk predictions are too extreme (slope {$<$} 1) or not extreme enough (slope {$>$} 1). We investigated the following shrinkage methods in comparison to standard maximum likelihood estimation: uniform shrinkage (likelihood-based and bootstrap-based), ridge regression, penalized maximum likelihood, LASSO regression, adaptive LASSO, non-negative garrote, and Firth's correction. There were three main findings. First, shrinkage improved calibration slopes on average. Second, the between-sample variability of calibration slopes was often increased relative to maximum likelihood. Among the shrinkage methods, the bootstrap-based uniform shrinkage worked well overall. In contrast to other shrinkage approaches, Firth's correction had only a small shrinkage effect but did so with low variability. Third, the correlation between the estimated shrinkage and the optimal shrinkage to remove overfitting was typically negative. Hence, although shrinkage improved predictions on average, it often worked poorly in individual datasets, in particular when shrinkage was most needed. The observed variability of shrinkage methods implies that these methods do not solve problems associated with small sample size or low number of events per variable.},

  abstract = {Statistical models that accurately reflect scientific knowledge are often, by necessity, infinite-dimensional. Estimation of smooth parameters using standard estimation techniques in such models is problematic. For example, maximum likelihood estimators often behave poorly in large models due to the fact that such estimators trade off bias and variance with respect to estimation of the density of the observed data, while the target parameter is a low-dimensional summary measure of this density. To obtain valid estimators in these situations, we must tailor the estimation procedure to the parameter of interest. Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) provides a template for constructing well-behaved estimators of smooth parameters in infinite-dimensional models. TMLE estimators are not only asymptotically consistent and normally distributed but also are designed to exhibit robust finite-sample performance. The remainder of this article provides an introduction to the TMLE procedure and discusses recent advances in the field of targeted learning.},

Such "outcome-wide epidemiology" will be especially important for exposures that may be beneficial for some outcomes but harmful for others. Outcome-wide epidemiology may also be helpful in prioritizing public health recommendations. Methodologically, the conduct of outcome-wide epidemiology will generally be more straightforward than recent proposals for exposure-wide epidemiologic studies, in which the associations between a single outcome and many exposures are assessed simultaneously. Such exposure-wide studies are likely to be subject to numerous biases because of the inability to make simultaneous confounding control and because exposures are likely to affect, and mediate the effects of, other exposures. These problems simplify considerably in an outcome-wide approach when a single exposure is being considered. Moreover, outcome-wide approaches will generally be more useful than exposure-wide approaches in shaping public health recommendations.},

  abstract = {Summary: The Illumina 450k array is a frequently used platform for large-scale genome-wide DNA methylation studies, i.e. epigenome-wide association studies. Currently, quality control of 450k data can be performed with Illumina’s GenomeStudio and is part of a limited number 450k analysis pipelines. However, GenomeStudio cannot handle large-scale studies, and existing pipelines provide limited options for quality control and neither support interactive exploration by the user.To aid the detection of bad-quality samples in large-scale genome-wide DNA methylation studies as flexible and transparent as possible, we have developed MethylAid; a visual and interactive Web application using RStudio’s shiny package. Bad-quality samples are detected using sample-dependent and sample-independent quality control probes present on the array and user-adjustable thresholds. In-depth exploration of bad-quality samples can be performed using several interactive diagnostic plots. Furthermore, plots can be annotated with user-provided metadata, for example, to identify outlying batches. Our new tool makes quality assessment of 450k array data interactive, flexible and efficient and is, therefore, expected to be useful for both data analysts and core facilities.Availability and implementation: MethylAid is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package (www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.0/bioc/html/MethylAid.html).

If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the study’s inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe five myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the influence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

  abstract = {A primary focus of an increasing number of scientific studies is to determine whether two exposures interact in the effect that they produce on an outcome of interest. Interaction is commonly assessed by fitting regression models in which the linear predictor includes the product between those exposures. When the main interest lies in the interaction, this approach is not entirely satisfactory, because it is prone to (possibly severe) bias when the main exposure effects or the associations between outcome and extraneous factors are misspecified. In this article we consider conditional mean models with identity or log link that postulate the statistical interaction in terms of a finite-dimensional parameter but are otherwise unspecified. We show that estimation of the interaction parameter often is not feasible in this model, because it requires nonparametric estimation of auxiliary conditional expectations given high-dimensional variables. We thus consider multiply robust estimation under a union model that assumes that at least one of several working submodels holds. Our approach is novel in that it makes use of information on the joint distribution of the exposures conditional on the extraneous factors in making inferences about the interaction parameter of interest. In the special case of a randomized trial or a family-based genetic study in which the joint exposure distribution is known by design or by Mendelian inheritance, the resulting multiply robust procedure leads to asymptotically distribution-free tests of the null hypothesis of no interaction on an additive scale. We illustrate the methods through simulation and analysis of a randomized follow-up study.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimates of the causal effects of socioeconomic position (SEP) on health is important for public health interventions. To do this, researchers must identify and adjust for all potential confounding variables while avoiding inappropriate adjustment for mediator variables on a causal pathway between the exposure and outcome. Unfortunately, 'overadjustment bias' remains a common and under-recognised problem in social epidemiology. This paper offers an introduction to selecting appropriate variables for adjustment when examining effects of SEP on health, with a focus on overadjustment bias. We discuss the challenges of estimating different causal effects including overadjustment bias, provide guidance on overcoming them, and consider specific issues including the timing of variables across the life-course, mutual adjustment for socioeconomic indicators, and conducting systematic reviews. We recommend three key steps to select the most appropriate variables for adjustment. First, researchers should be clear about their research question and causal effect of interest. Second, using expert knowledge and theory, researchers should draw causal diagrams representing their assumptions about the interrelationships between their variables of interest. Third, based on their causal diagram(s) and causal effect(s) of interest, researchers should select most appropriate set of variables, which maximises adjustment for confounding while minimising adjustment for mediators.},

Violation of the ‘no horizontal pleiotropy’ assumption can cause severe bias in MR. We developed the Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test to identify horizontal pleiotropic outliers in multi-instrument summary-level MR testing. We showed using simulations that the MR-PRESSO test is best suited when horizontal pleiotropy occurs in\,{$<$}50\% of instruments. Next we applied the MR-PRESSO test, along with several other MR tests, to complex traits and diseases and found that horizontal pleiotropy (i) was detectable in over 48\% of significant causal relationships in MR; (ii) introduced distortions in the causal estimates in MR that ranged on average from –131\% to 201\%; (iii) induced false-positive causal relationships in up to 10\% of relationships; and (iv) could be corrected in some but not all instances.},

  abstract = {Background Early life exposure to neurotoxicants and non-chemical psychosocial stressors can impede development of prefrontal cortical functions that promote behavioral regulation and thereby may predispose to adolescent risk-taking related behaviors (e.g., substance use or high-risk sexual activity). This is particularly concerning for communities exposed to multiple stressors. Methods This study examined the relation of exposure to mixtures of chemical stressors, non-chemical psychosocial stressors, and other risk factors with neuropsychological correlates of risk-taking. Specifically, we assessed psychometric measures of both adverse behavioral regulation and adaptive attributes among adolescents (age\,∼\,15\,years) in the New Bedford Cohort (NBC), a sociodemographically diverse cohort of 788 children born 1993–1998 to mothers residing near the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site. The NBC includes biomarkers of prenatal exposure to organochlorines and metals; sociodemographic, parental and home characteristics; and periodic neurodevelopmental assessments. We modelled exposure mixtures using multi-dimensional smooths within generalized additive models. Results Children of younger mothers with lower IQ who were exposed prenatally to higher polychlorinated biphenyls and lead had poorer anger control. This pattern was not apparent for children of older mothers with higher IQs. Direction of associations between increased hyperactivity and prenatal levels of organochlorine mixtures differed by maternal age and depression symptoms. Higher cord blood Pb levels, in conjunction with poorer HOME scores, were associated with poorer self-esteem when mothers had fewer depression symptoms. Conclusions Analyses suggest that prenatal chemical exposures and non-chemical factors interact to contribute to neuropsychological correlates of risk-taking behaviors in adolescence. By simultaneously considering multiple factors associated with adverse behavioral regulation, we identified potential high-risk combinations that reflect both chemical and psychosocial stressors amenable to intervention.},

  abstract = {Exposure to environmental stressors, toxicants, and nutrient deficiencies can affect DNA in several ways. Some exposures cause damage and alter the structure of DNA, but there is increasing evidence that the same or other environmental exposures, including those that occur during fetal development in utero, can cause epigenetic effects that modulate DNA function and gene expression. Some epigenetic changes to DNA that affect gene transcription are at least partially reversible (i.e., they can be enzymatically reversed after cessation of exposure to environmental agents), but some epigenetic modifications seem to persist, even for decades. To explain the effects of early life experiences (such as famine and exposures to other stressors) on the long-term persistence of specific patterns of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, we propose an analogy with immune memory. We propose that an epigenetic memory can be established and maintained in self-renewing stem cell compartments. We suggest that the observations on early life effects on adult diseases and the persistence of methylation changes in smokers support our hypothesis, for which a mechanistic basis, however, needs to be further clarified. We outline a new model based on methylation changes. Although these changes seem to be mainly adaptive, they are also implicated in the pathogenesis and onset of diseases, depending on individual genotypic background and types of subsequent exposures. Elucidating the relationships between the adaptive and maladaptive consequences of the epigenetic modifications that result from complex environmental exposures is a major challenge for current and future research in epigenetics.-Vineis, P., Chatziioannou, A., Cunliffe, V.

  abstract = {Background: Chemical and nonchemical environmental exposures are increasingly suspected to influence the development of obesity, especially during early life, but studies mostly consider single exposure groups. Objectives: Our study aimed to systematically assess the association between a wide array of early-life environmental exposures and childhood obesity, using an exposome-wide approach. Methods: The HELIX (Human Early Life Exposome) study measured child body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, skinfold thickness, and body fat mass in 1,301 children from six European birth cohorts age 6–11 y. We estimated 77 prenatal exposures and 96 childhood exposures (cross-sectionally), including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, built environment, green spaces, tobacco smoking, and biomarkers of chemical pollutants (persistent organic pollutants, metals, phthalates, phenols, and pesticides). We used an exposure-wide association study (ExWAS) to screen all exposure–outcome associations independently and used the deletion-substitution-addition (DSA) variable selection algorithm to build a final multiexposure model. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity combined was 28.8\%. Maternal smoking was the only prenatal exposure variable associated with higher child BMI (z-score increase of 0.28, 95\% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.48, for active vs. no smoking). For childhood exposures, the multiexposure model identified particulate and nitrogen dioxide air pollution inside the home, urine cotinine levels indicative of secondhand smoke exposure, and residence in more densely populated areas and in areas with fewer facilities to be associated with increased child BMI. Child blood levels of copper and cesium were associated with higher BMI, and levels of organochlorine pollutants, cobalt, and molybdenum were associated with lower BMI. Similar results were found for the other adiposity outcomes. Discussion: This first comprehensive and systematic analysis of many suspected environmental obesogens strengthens evidence for an association of smoking, air pollution exposure, and characteristics of the built environment with childhood obesity risk. Cross-sectional biomarker results may suffer from reverse causality bias, whereby obesity status influenced the biomarker concentration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5975},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developmental periods in early life may be particularly vulnerable to impacts of environmental exposures. Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure-health effect relationships. The "exposome" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. OBJECTIVES: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the "early-life exposome." Here we describe the general design of the project. METHODS: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. CONCLUSIONS: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, it will form an important first step toward the life-course exposome.},

  abstract = {Background: Long-term behavioral and health risk factors constitute a primary focus of research on the etiology of chronic diseases. Yet, identifying critical time-windows during which risk factors have the strongest impact on disease risk is challenging. To assess the trajectory of association of an exposure history with an outcome, the weighted cumulative exposure index (WCIE) has been proposed, with weights reflecting the relative importance of exposures at different times. However, WCIE is restricted to a complete observed error-free exposure whereas exposures are often measured with intermittent missingness and error. Moreover, it rarely explores exposure history that is very distant from the outcome as usually sought in life-course epidemiology. Methods: We extend the WCIE methodology to (i) exposures that are intermittently measured with error, and (ii) contexts where the exposure time-window precedes the outcome time-window using a landmark approach. First, the individual exposure history up to the landmark time is estimated using a mixed model that handles missing data and error in exposure measurement, and the predicted complete error-free exposure history is derived. Then the WCIE methodology is applied to assess the trajectory of association between the predicted exposure history and the health outcome collected after the landmark time. In our context, the health outcome is a longitudinal marker analyzed using a mixed model. Results: A simulation study first demonstrates the correct inference obtained with this approach. Then, applied to the Nurses’ Health Study (19,415 women) to investigate the association between body mass index history (collected from midlife) and subsequent cognitive decline (evaluated after age 70), the method identified two major critical windows of association: long before the first cognitive evaluation (roughly 24 to 12 years), higher levels of BMI were associated with poorer cognition. In contrast, adjusted for the whole history, higher levels of BMI became associated with better cognition in the last years prior to the first cognitive interview, thus reflecting reverse causation (changes in exposure due to underlying disease). Conclusions: This approach, easy to implement, provides a flexible tool for studying complex dynamic relationships and identifying critical time windows while accounting for exposure measurement errors.},

  abstract = {Exposure to traffic-related pollutants, including diesel exhaust, is associated with increased risk of cardiopulmonary disease and mortality; however, the precise biochemical pathways underlying these effects are not known. To investigate biological response mechanisms underlying exposure to traffic related pollutants, we used an integrated molecular response approach that included high-resolution metabolomic profiling and peripheral blood gene expression to identify biological responses to diesel exhaust exposure. Plasma samples were collected from 73 non-smoking males employed in the US trucking industry between February 2009 and October 2010, and analyzed using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics to characterize metabolite associations with shift- and week-averaged levels of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Metabolic associations with EC, OC and PM2.5 were evaluated for biochemical processes known to be associated with disease risk. Annotated metabolites associated with exposure were then tested for relationships with the peripheral blood transcriptome using multivariate selection and network correlation. Week-averaged EC and OC levels, which were averaged across multiple shifts during the workweek, resulted in the greatest exposure-associated metabolic alterations compared to shift-averaged exposure levels. Metabolic changes associated with EC exposure suggest increased lipid peroxidation products, biomarkers of oxidative stress, thrombotic signaling lipids, and metabolites associated with endothelial dysfunction from altered nitric oxide metabolism, while OC exposures were associated with antioxidants, oxidative stress biomarkers and critical intermediates in nitric oxide production. Correlation with whole blood RNA gene expression provided additional evidence of changes in processes related to endothelial function, immune response, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We did not detect metabolic associations with PM2.5. This study provides an integrated molecular assessment of human exposure to traffic-related air pollutants that includes diesel exhaust. Metabolite and transcriptomic changes associated with exposure to EC and OC are consistent with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and the adverse health effects of traffic-related air pollution.},

  abstract = {Penalized likelihood approaches are widely used for high-dimensional regression. Although many methods have been proposed and the associated theory is now well developed, the relative efficacy of different approaches in finite-sample settings, as encountered in practice, remains incompletely understood. There is therefore a need for empirical investigations in this area that can offer practical insight and guidance to users. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of penalized regression methods. We distinguish between three related goals: prediction, variable selection and variable ranking. Our results span more than 2300 data-generating scenarios, including both synthetic and semisynthetic data (real covariates and simulated responses), allowing us to systematically consider the influence of various factors (sample size, dimensionality, sparsity, signal strength and multicollinearity). We consider several widely used approaches (Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge Regression, SCAD, the Dantzig Selector and Stability Selection). We find considerable variation in performance between methods. Our results support a "no panacea" view, with no unambiguous winner across all scenarios or goals, even in this restricted setting where all data align well with the assumptions underlying the methods. The study allows us to make some recommendations as to which approaches may be most (or least) suitable given the goal and some data characteristics. Our empirical results complement existing theory and provide a resource to compare methods across a range of scenarios and metrics.},

Phthalates can be found in most products that have contact with plastics during producing, packaging, or delivering. Despite the short half-lives in tissues, chronic exposure to phthalates will adversely influence the endocrine system and functioning of multiple organs, which has negative long-term impacts on the success of pregnancy, child growth and development, and reproductive systems in both young children and adolescents. Several countries have established restrictions and regulations on some types of phthalates; however, we think that more countries should establish constraints or substitute measures for phthalates to reduce health risks.

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis with random interventions has become an area of significant interest for understanding time-varying effects with longitudinal and survival outcomes. To tackle causal and statistical challenges due to the complex longitudinal data structure with time-varying confounders, competing risks, and informative censoring, there exists a general desire to combine machine learning techniques and semiparametric theory. In this manuscript, we focus on targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) of longitudinal natural direct and indirect effects defined with random interventions. The proposed estimators are multiply robust, locally efficient, and directly estimate and update the conditional densities that factorize data likelihoods. We utilize the highly adaptive lasso (HAL) and projection representations to derive new estimators (HAL-EIC) of the efficient influence curves of longitudinal mediation problems and propose a fast one-step TMLE algorithm using HAL-EIC while preserving the asymptotic properties. The proposed method can be generalized for other longitudinal causal parameters that are smooth functions of data likelihoods, and thereby provides a novel and flexible statistical toolbox.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although studies in laboratory animals demonstrate neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal or postnatal organophosphate pesticide (OP) exposure, there is limited evidence on effects induced by not only prenatal but also postnatal exposure of children to OPs. METHODS: We measured diethylphosphate (DE), dimethylphosphate (DM), and total dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites in maternal and child urine at 12 and 24months of age and examined their relationship with developmental quotients (DQs) in 12-month-old infants and 24-month-old children in Shandong, China. RESULTS: The median concentrations of total DAP metabolites (DAPs) in child urine [371.97nmol/g creatinine (12-month-old infants), 538.64nmol/g creatinine (24-month-old children)] were higher than those in maternal urine (352.67nmol/g creatinine). Prenatal OP exposure was negatively associated with 24-month-old children's DQs, especially among boys. A 10-fold increase in prenatal DEs and DAPs was associated with a 2.59- and 2.49-point decrease in social domain DQ scores in 24-month-old children (n=262), respectively. However, positive association of postnatal exposure to OPs and 24-month-old children's DQs was observed (n=237). Neither prenatal nor postnatal exposure to OPs was related to 12-month-old infants' DQs. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that prenatal OP exposure could adversely affect children's neurodevelopment at 24months of age, especially among boys. The prenatal period might be a critical window of OP exposure. In view of the positive association with postnatal OP exposure, it is necessary to interpret findings with caution.},

  abstract = {Background Growing evidence exists about the fetal and environmental origins of hypertension, but mainly limited to single-exposure studies. The exposome has been proposed as a more holistic approach by studying many exposures simultaneously. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the association between a wide range of prenatal and postnatal exposures and blood pressure (BP) in children. Methods Systolic and diastolic BP were measured among 1,277 children from the European HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) cohort aged 6 to 11 years. Prenatal (n~=~89) and postnatal (n~=~128) exposures include air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals, and lifestyles. Two methods adjusted for confounders were applied: an exposome-wide association study considering the exposures independently, and the deletion-substitution-addition algorithm considering all the exposures simultaneously. Results Decreases in systolic BP were observed with facility density (β change for an interquartile-range increase in exposure: −1.7~mm~Hg [95\% confidence interval (CI):~−2.5 to~−0.8~mm~Hg]), maternal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 118 (−1.4~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−2.6 to~−0.2~mm~Hg]) and child concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE:~−1.6~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−2.4 to~−0.7~mm~Hg]), hexachlorobenzene (−1.5~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−2.4 to~−0.6~mm~Hg]), and mono−benzyl phthalate (−0.7~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−1.3 to~−0.1~mm~Hg]), whereas increases in systolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature during pregnancy (1.6~mm~Hg [95\%~CI: 0.2 to 2.9~mm~Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (2.0~mm~Hg [95\%~CI: 0.4 to 3.5~mm~Hg]), maternal cotinine concentrations (1.2~mm~Hg [95\%~CI: -0.3 to 2.8~mm~Hg]), and child perfluorooctanoate concentrations (0.9~mm~Hg [95\%~CI: 0.1 to 1.6~mm~Hg]). Decreases in diastolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature at examination (−1.4~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−2.3 to~−0.5~mm~Hg]) and child DDE concentrations (−1.1~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−1.9 to~−0.3~mm~Hg]), whereas increases in diastolic BP were observed with maternal bisphenol-A concentrations (0.7~mm~Hg [95\%~CI: 0.1 to 1.4~mm~Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (1.2~mm~Hg [95\%~CI:~−0.2 to 2.7~mm~Hg]), and child copper concentrations (0.9~mm~Hg [95\%~CI: 0.3 to 1.6~mm~Hg]). Conclusions This study suggests that early-life exposure to several chemicals, as well as built environment and meteorological factors, may affect BP in children.},

Women?s intrauterine environments are positioned in the media as central to the intergenerational transmission of obesity, with women portrayed as responsible for passing obesity on to their children (and grandchildren) via biology and ill-informed ?lifestyle choices?.

  abstract = {Inositols, a group of 6-carbon polyols, are highly bioactive molecules derived from diet and endogenous synthesis. Inositols and their derivatives are involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and participate in insulin-signaling, with perturbations in inositol processing being associated with conditions involving insulin resistance, dysglycemia and dyslipidemia such as polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes. Pregnancy is similarly characterized by substantial and complex changes in glycemic and lipidomic regulation as part of maternal adaptation and is also associated with physiological alterations in inositol processing. Disruptions in maternal adaptation are postulated to have a critical pathophysiological role in pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Inositol supplementation has shown promise as an intervention for the alleviation of symptoms in conditions of insulin resistance and for gestational diabetes prevention. However, the mechanisms behind these affects are not fully understood. In this review, we explore the role of inositols in conditions of insulin dysregulation and in pregnancy, and identify priority areas for research. We particularly examine the role and function of inositols within the maternal-placental-fetal axis in both uncomplicated and pathological pregnancies. We also discuss how inositols may mediate maternal-placental-fetal cross-talk, and regulate fetal growth and development, and suggest that inositols play a vital role in promoting healthy pregnancy.},

However, little attention is paid to how the EMMs required may vary depending on the mathematical nuances of each effect measure. We defined 2 types of EMMs: a marginal EMM, where the effect on the scale of interest differs across levels of a variable, and a conditional EMM, where the effect differs conditional on other variables associated with the outcome. These types define 3 classes of variables: class 1 (conditional EMM), class 2 (marginal but not conditional EMM), and class 3 (neither marginal nor conditional EMM). Class 1 variables are necessary to achieve a valid estimate of the RD in a target population, while an RR requires class 1 and class 2 and an OR requires classes 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., all variables associated with the outcome). This does not mean that fewer variables are required for an externally valid RD (because variables may not modify effects on all scales), but it does suggest that researchers should consider the scale of the effect measure when identifying an EMM necessary for an externally valid treatment effect estimate.},

This assumption is part of the potential outcomes framework for causal inference, and it is needed for well-defined potential outcomes, as multiple versions of the same treatment could lead to different health risks for the same level of treatment. Since 2 locations can have the same outdoor PM2.5 mass concentration (i.e., treatment) but different chemical compositions (i.e., versions of treatment), violations of the “no-multiple-versions-of-treatment” assumption seem likely. Importantly, violations of this assumption will not bias health risk estimates for PM2.5 mass concentrations if there are no unmeasured confounders of the “version of treatment”–outcome relationship. However, confounding can occur if these factors are not identified and controlled for in the analysis. We describe situations in which this may occur and provide simulations to estimate the magnitude and direction of this possible bias. In general, violations of the “no-multiple-versions-of-treatment” assumption could be an underappreciated source of bias in studies of outdoor PM2.5. Analysis of the health impacts of outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations across spatial domains with similar composition could help to address this issue.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe analysis of health effects of exposure to mixtures is a critically important issue in human epidemiology, and increasing effort is being devoted to developing methods for this problem. A key feature of environmental mixtures is that some components can be highly correlated, raising the issues of confounding by coexposure and colinearity. A relatively unexplored topic in epidemiologic analysis of mixtures is the impact of residual confounding bias due to unmeasured or unknown variables.ObjectivesThis paper examines the potential amplification of such biases when correlated exposure variables are included in regression models.MethodsWe use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to describe different simple scenarios involving residual confounding. We derive expressions for the expected value of the resulting bias using linear models and multiple linear regression.ResultsApproaches to the analysis of mixtures that involve regressing the outcome on several exposures simultaneously can in some cases amplify rather than reduce confounding bias.DiscussionsThe problem of bias amplification can worsen with stronger correlation between mixture components or when more mixture components are included in the model.ConclusionsInvestigators must consider steps to minimize possible bias amplification in the design and analysis of epidemiologic studies of multiple correlated exposures. This may be particularly important when biomarkers of exposure are used. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2450.},

  abstract = {Background Exposure to consumer product chemicals during pregnancy may increase susceptibility to pregnancy disorders by influencing maternal inflammation. However, effects on specific inflammatory pathways have not been well characterized. Oxylipins are a diverse class of lipids that act as important mediators and biomarkers of several biological pathways that regulate inflammation. Adverse pregnancy outcomes have been associated with circulating oxylipin levels in pregnancy. In this study, we aimed to determine the longitudinal associations between plasma oxylipins and urinary biomarkers of three classes of consumer product chemicals among pregnant women. Methods Data come from a study of 90 pregnant women nested within the LIFECODES cohort. Maternal plasma and urine were collected at three prenatal visits. Plasma was analyzed for 61 oxylipins, which were grouped according to biosynthetic pathways that we defined by upstream: 1) fatty acid precursor, including linoleic, arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, or eicosapentaenoic acid; and 2) enzyme pathway, including cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or cytochrome P450 (CYP). Urine was analyzed for 12 phenol, 12 phthalate, and 9 organophosphate ester (OPE) biomarkers. Linear mixed effect models were used for single-pollutant analyses. We implemented a novel extension of quantile g-computation for longitudinal data to examine the joint effect of class-specific chemical mixtures on individual plasma oxylipin concentrations. Results We found that urinary biomarkers of consumer product chemicals were positively associated with pro-inflammatory oxylipins from several biosynthetic pathways. Importantly, these associations depended upon the chemical class of exposure biomarker. We estimated positive associations between urinary phenol biomarkers and oxylipins produced from arachidonic acid by LOX enzymes, including several important pro-inflammatory hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). On average, mean concentrations of oxylipin produced from the arachidonic acid/LOX pathway were 48\%–71\% higher per quartile increase in the phenol biomarker mixture. For example, a simultaneous quartile increase in all urinary phenols was associated with 53\% higher (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 11\%, 111\%) concentrations of 12-HETE. The positive associations among phenols were primarily driven by methyl paraben, 2,5-dichlorophenol, and triclosan. Additionally, we observed that phthalate and OPE metabolites were associated with higher concentrations of oxylipins produced from linoleic acid by CYP enzymes, including the pro-inflammatory dihydroxy-octadecenoic acids (DiHOMEs). Associations among DiHOME oxylipins were driven by metabolites of benzylbutyl and di-isodecyl phthalate, and by the metabolite of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate among OPEs. We also observed inverse associations between phthalate and OPE metabolites and oxylipins produced from other pathways; however, adjusting for a plasma indicator of dietary fatty acid intake attenuated those results. Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis that consumer product chemicals may have diverse impacts on inflammation processes in pregnancy. Certain pro-inflammatory oxylipins were generally higher among participants with higher urinary chemical biomarker concentrations. Associations varied by class of chemical and by the biosynthetic pathway of oxylipin production, indicating potential specificity in the inflammatory effects of these environmental chemicals during pregnancy that warrant investigation in larger studies.},

  abstract = {Phthalate exposure is widespread among pregnant women and may be a risk factor for preterm birth.To investigate the prospective association between urinary biomarkers of phthalates in pregnancy and preterm birth among individuals living in the US.Individual-level data were pooled from 16 preconception and pregnancy studies conducted in the US. Pregnant individuals who delivered between 1983 and 2018 and provided 1 or more urine samples during pregnancy were included.Urinary phthalate metabolites were quantified as biomarkers of phthalate exposure. Concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites were standardized for urine dilution and mean repeated measurements across pregnancy were calculated.Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between each phthalate metabolite with the odds of preterm birth, defined as less than 37 weeks of gestation at delivery (n\,=\,539). Models pooled data using fixed effects and adjusted for maternal age, race and ethnicity, education, and prepregnancy body mass index. The association between the overall mixture of phthalate metabolites and preterm birth was also examined with logistic regression. G-computation, which requires certain assumptions to be considered causal, was used to estimate the association with hypothetical interventions to reduce the mixture concentrations on preterm birth.The final analytic sample included 6045 participants (mean [SD] age, 29.1 [6.1] years). Overall, 802 individuals (13.3\%) were Black, 2323 (38.4\%) were Hispanic/Latina, 2576 (42.6\%) were White, and 328 (5.4\%) had other race and ethnicity (including American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, \&gt;1 racial identity, or reported as other). Most phthalate metabolites were detected in more than 96\% of participants. Higher odds of preterm birth, ranging from 12\% to 16\%, were observed in association with an interquartile range increase in urinary concentrations of mono-n-butyl phthalate (odds ratio [OR], 1.12 [95\% CI, 0.98-1.27]), mono-isobutyl phthalate (OR, 1.16 [95\% CI, 1.00-1.34]), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (OR, 1.16 [95\% CI, 1.00-1.34]), and mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (OR, 1.14 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.29]). Among approximately 90 preterm births per 1000 live births in this study population, hypothetical interventions to reduce the mixture of phthalate metabolite levels by 10\%, 30\%, and 50\% were estimated to prevent 1.8 (95\% CI, 0.5-3.1), 5.9 (95\% CI, 1.7-9.9), and 11.1 (95\% CI, 3.6-18.3) preterm births, respectively.Results from this large US study population suggest that phthalate exposure during pregnancy may be a preventable risk factor for preterm delivery.},

When treatment strategies are deterministic, estimators derived from the so-called efficient influence function (EIF) for the g-formula will be doubly robust to model misspecification. In recent years, several practical applications have motivated estimation of the g-formula under non-deterministic treatment strategies where treatment assignment at each time point depends on the observed treatment process. In this case, EIF-based estimators may or may not be doubly robust. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of doubly robust estimators for intervention treatment distributions that depend on the observed treatment process for point treatment interventions and give a class of intervention treatment distributions dependent on the observed treatment process that guarantee model doubly and multiply robust estimators in longitudinal settings. Motivated by an application to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation studies, we propose a new treatment intervention dependent on the observed treatment process. We show there exist (1) estimators that are doubly and multiply robust to model misspecification and (2) estimators that when used with machine learning algorithms can attain fast convergence rates for our proposed intervention. Finally, we explore the finite sample performance of our estimators via simulation studies.},

However, most approaches to these issues have considered external validity separately from internal validity. Here we argue that considering either internal or external validity in isolation may be problematic. Further, we argue that a joint measure of the validity of an effect estimate with respect to a specific population of interest may be more useful: We call this proposed measure target validity. In this work, we introduce and formally define target bias as the total difference between the true causal effect in the target population and the estimated causal effect in the study sample, and target validity as target bias = 0. We illustrate this measure with a series of examples and show how this measure may help us to think more clearly about comparisons between experimental and nonexperimental research results. Specifically, we show that even perfect internal validity does not ensure that a causal effect will be unbiased in a specific target population.},

We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

  abstract = {Summary The ‘birthweight paradox’ describes the phenomenon whereby birthweight-specific mortality curves cross when stratified on other exposures, most notably cigarette smoking. The paradox has been noted widely in the literature and numerous explanations and corrections have been suggested. Recently, causal diagrams have been used to illustrate the possibility for collider-stratification bias in models adjusting for birthweight. When two variables share a common effect, stratification on the variable representing that effect induces a statistical relation between otherwise independent factors. This bias has been proposed to explain the birthweight paradox., Causal diagrams may illustrate sources of bias, but are limited to describing qualitative effects. In this paper, we provide causal diagrams that illustrate the birthweight paradox and use a simulation study to quantify the collider-stratification bias under a range of circumstances. Considered circumstances include exposures with and without direct effects on neonatal mortality, as well as with and without indirect effects acting through birthweight on neonatal mortality. The results of these simulations illustrate that when the birthweight-mortality relation is subject to substantial uncontrolled confounding, the bias on estimates of effect adjusted for birthweight may be sufficient to yield opposite causal conclusions, i.e. a factor that poses increased risk appears protective. Effects on stratum-specific birthweight-mortality curves were considered to illustrate the connection between collider-stratification bias and the crossing of the curves. The simulations demonstrate the conditions necessary to give rise to empirical evidence of the paradox.},

  abstract = {Although randomization provides a gold-standard method of assessing causal relationships, it is not always possible to randomly allocate exposures. Where exposures are not randomized, estimating exposure effects is complicated by confounding. The traditional approach to dealing with confounding is to adjust for measured confounding variables within a regression model for the outcome variable. An alternative approach—propensity scoring—instead fits a regression model to the exposure variable. For a binary exposure, the propensity score is the probability of being exposed, given the measured confounders. These scores can be estimated from the data, for example by fitting a logistic regression model for the exposure including the confounders as explanatory variables and obtaining the estimated propensity scores from the predicted exposure probabilities from this model. These estimated propensity scores can then be used in various ways—matching, stratification, covariate-adjustment or inverse-probability weighting—to obtain estimates of the exposure effect. In this paper, we provide an introduction to propensity score methodology and review its use within respiratory health research. We illustrate propensity score methods by investigating the research question: ‘Does personal smoking affect the risk of subsequent asthma?’ using data taken from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study.},

  abstract = {Exposures to environmental chemicals during gestation can alter health status later in life. Most studies of maternal exposure to chemicals during pregnancy have focused on a single chemical exposure observed at high temporal resolution. Recent research has turned to focus on exposure to mixtures of multiple chemicals, generally observed at a single time point. We consider statistical methods for analyzing data on chemical mixtures that are observed at a high temporal resolution. As motivation, we analyze the association between exposure to four ambient air pollutants observed weekly throughout gestation and birth weight in a Boston-area prospective birth cohort. To explore patterns in the data, we first apply methods for analyzing data on (1) a single chemical observed at high temporal resolution, and (2) a mixture measured at a single point in time. We highlight the shortcomings of these approaches for temporally-resolved data on exposure to chemical mixtures. Second, we propose a novel method, a Bayesian kernel machine regression distributed lag model (BKMR-DLM), that simultaneously accounts for nonlinear associations and interactions among time-varying measures of exposure to mixtures. BKMR-DLM uses a functional weight for each exposure that parameterizes the window of susceptibility corresponding to that exposure within a kernel machine framework that captures non-linear and interaction effects of the multivariate exposure on the outcome. In a simulation study, we show that the proposed method can better estimate the exposure-response function and, in high signal settings, can identify critical windows in time during which exposure has an increased association with the outcome. Applying the proposed method to the Boston birth cohort data, we find evidence of a negative association between organic carbon and birth weight and that nitrate modifies the organic carbon, ...},

  abstract = {Benzophenone-3 (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, oxybenzone, or BP-3) is one of the most frequently used UV radiation absorbents, which are commonly referred to as sunscreen filters. Its widespread use in industrial applications provides protection against the photodegradation of a wide range of products but at the same time creates the risk of human exposure to benzophenone-3 unbeknownst to the individuals exposed. Topically applied benzophenone-3 penetrates individual skin layers, enters the bloodstream, and is excreted in the urine. In addition, benzophenone-3 easily crosses the placental barrier, which creates the risk of exposure to this substance in the prenatal period. Despite the widespread use and occurrence of benzophenone-3 in the human environment, little knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the effect of benzophenone-3 on the nervous system was available until recently. Only the most recent research, including studies by our group, has enabled the identification of new molecular mechanisms through which benzophenone-3 affects embryonic neuronal cells and the developing mammalian brain. Benzophenone-3 has been shown to induce neurotoxicity and apoptotic processes and inhibit autophagy in embryonic neuronal cells. Benzophenone-3 also alters expression and impairs function of receptors necessary for the proper development and function of the nervous system. The most worrying finding seems to be that benzophenone-3 contributes to an increased risk of developmental abnormalities and/or epigenetically based degeneration of neuronal cells by changing the epigenetic status of neuronal cells.},

  abstract = {The UV absorber benzophenone-3 (BP-3) is the most extensively used chemical substance in various personal care products. Despite that BP-3 exposure is widespread, knowledge about the impact of BP-3 on the brain development is negligible. The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms of prenatal exposure to BP-3 in neuronal cells, with particular emphasis on autophagy and nuclear receptors signaling as well as the epigenetic and post-translational modifications occurring in response to BP-3. To observe the impact of prenatal exposure to BP-3, we administered BP-3 to pregnant mice, and next, we isolated brain tissue from pretreated embryos for primary cell~neocortical culture. Our study revealed that prenatal exposure to BP-3 (used in environmentally relevant doses) impairs autophagy in terms of BECLIN-1, MAP1LC3B, autophagosomes, and autophagy-related factors; disrupts the levels of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ); alters epigenetic status (i.e., attenuates HDAC and sirtuin activities); inhibits post-translational modifications in terms of global sumoylation; and dysregulates expression of neurogenesis- and neurotransmitter-related genes as well as miRNAs involved in pathologies of the nervous system. Our study also showed that BP-3 has good permeability through the BBB. We strongly suggest that BP-3-evoked effects may substantiate a fetal basis of the adult onset of neurological diseases, particularly schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many phthalates and phenols are hormonally active and are suspected to alter the course of development. OBJECTIVE: We investigated prenatal exposures to phthalate and phenol metabolites and their associations with body size measures of the infants at birth. METHODS: We measured 5 phenol and 10 phthalate urinary metabolites in a multiethnic cohort of 404 women in New York City during their third trimester of pregnancy and recorded size of infants at birth. RESULTS: Median urinary concentrations were {$>$} 10 microg/L for 2 of 5 phenols and 6 of 10 phthalate monoester metabolites. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight phthalate monoesters (low-MWP) were approximately 5-fold greater than those of high-molecular-weight metabolites. Low-MWP metabolites had a positive association with gestational age [0.97 day gestational age per ln-biomarker; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.07-1.9 days, multivariate adjusted] and with head circumference. Higher prenatal exposures to 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP) predicted lower birth weight in boys (-210 g average birth weight difference between the third tertile and first tertile of 2,5-DCP; 95\% CI, 71-348 g). Higher maternal benzophenone-3 (BP3) concentrations were associated with a similar decrease in birth weight among girls but with greater birth weight in boys. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a range of phthalate and phenol exposures during pregnancy in our population, but few were associated with birth size. The association of 2,5-DCP and BP3 with reduced or increased birth weight could be important in very early or small-size births. In addition, positive associations of urinary metabolites with some outcomes may be attributable partly to unresolved confounding with maternal anthropometric factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to investigate the effect of public masking mandates in US states on COVID-19 at the national level in Fall 2020. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate how the relative growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths would have differed if all states had issued a mandate to mask in public by 1 September 2020 versus if all states had delayed issuing such a mandate. METHODS: We applied the Causal Roadmap, a formal framework for causal and statistical inference. We defined the outcome as the state-specific relative increase in cumulative cases and in cumulative deaths 21, 30, 45, and 60 days after 1 September. Despite the natural experiment occurring at the state-level, the causal effect of masking policies on COVID-19 outcomes was not identifiable. Nonetheless, we specified the target statistical parameter as the adjusted rate ratio (aRR): the expected outcome with early implementation divided by the expected outcome with delayed implementation, after adjusting for state-level confounders. To minimize strong estimation assumptions, primary analyses used targeted maximum likelihood estimation with Super Learner. RESULTS: After 60 days and at a national level, early implementation was associated with a 9\% reduction in new COVID-19 cases (aRR = 0.91 [95\% CI = 0.88, 0.95]) and a 16\% reduction in new COVID-19 deaths (aRR = 0.84 [95\% CI = 0.76, 0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Although lack of identifiability prohibited causal interpretations, application of the Causal Roadmap facilitated estimation and inference of statistical associations, providing timely answers to pressing questions in the COVID-19 response.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exploratory factor analysis is a commonly used statistical technique in metabolic syndrome research to uncover latent structure amongst metabolic variables. The application of factor analysis requires methodological decisions that reflect the hypothesis of the metabolic syndrome construct. These decisions often raise the complexity of the interpretation from the output. We propose two alternative techniques developed from cluster analysis which can achieve a clinically relevant structure, whilst maintaining intuitive advantages of clustering methodology. METHODS: Two advanced techniques of clustering in the VARCLUS and matroid methods are discussed and implemented on a metabolic syndrome data set to analyze the structure of ten metabolic risk factors. The subjects were selected from the normative aging study based in Boston, Massachusetts. The sample included a total of 847 men aged between 21 and 81 years who provided complete data on selected risk factors during the period 1987 to 1991. RESULTS: Four core components were identified by the clustering methods. These are labelled obesity, lipids, insulin resistance and blood pressure. The exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation suggested an overlap of the loadings identified on the insulin resistance and obesity factors. The VARCLUS and matroid analyses separated these components and were able to demonstrate associations between individual risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: An oblique rotation can be selected to reflect the clinical concept of a single underlying syndrome, however the results are often difficult to interpret. Factor loadings must be considered along with correlations between the factors. The correlated components produced by the VARCLUS and matroid analyses are not overlapped, which allows for a simpler application of the methodologies and interpretation of the results. These techniques encourage consistency in the interpretation whilst remaining faithful to the construct under study.},

  abstract = {Objective Metabolomics may unravel global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures and identify important biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of childhood obesity. Phthalate has been considered an obesogen and contributing to overweight and obesity in children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in urine metabolites in response to the environmental phthalate exposure among overweight or obese children, and to investigate the metabolic mechanisms involved in the obesogenic effect of phthalate on children at puberty. Methods Within the national Puberty Timing and Health Effects in Chinese Children (PTHEC) study, 69 overweight/obese children and 80 normal weight children were selected into the current study according to their puberty timing and WGOC (The Working Group for obesity in China) references. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate monoesters (MMP, MEP, MnBP, MEHP, MEOHP and MEHHP) were measured using API 2000 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESIMS/MS). Metabolomic profiling of spot urine was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed urinary metabolites associated with phthalate monoesters exposure were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and multiple linear regression models. In addition, the candidate metabolites were regressed to obesity indices with multiple linear regression models and logistic regression models in all subjects. Results Compared with normal weight children, higher levels of MnBP were detected in urinary samples of children with overweight and obesity. After adjusting for confounders including chronological age, gender, puberty onset, daily energy intake and physical activity and socio-economic level, positive association remained between urinary MnBP concentration and childhood overweight/obesity [OR\,=\,1.586, 95\% CI:1.043,2.412]. We observed elevated MnBP concentration was significantly correlated with increased levels of monostearin, 1-monopalmitin, stearic acid, itaconic acid, glycerol 3-phosphate, 5-methoxytryptamine, kyotorphin, 1-methylhydantoin, d-alanyl-d-alanine, pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol, and butyraldehyde. Meanwhile, increased MnBP concentration was also significantly correlated with decreased levels of lactate, glucose 6-phosphate, d-fructose 6-phosphate, palmitic acid, 4-acetamidobutyric acid, l-glutamic acid, n-acetyl-l-phenylalanine, iminodiacetic acid, hydroxyproline, pipecolinic acid, l-ornithine, n-acetyl-l-glutamic acid, guanosine, cytosin, and (s)-mandelic acid in the normal weight subjects. The observations indicated that MnBP exposure was related to global urine metabolic abnormalities characterized by disrupting arginine and proline metabolism and increasing oxidative stress and fatty acid reesterification. Among the metabolic markers related to MnBP exposure, 1-methylhydantoin, pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid and monostearin were found to be positively correlated with obesity indices, while hydroxyproline, l-ornithine, and lactate were negatively associated with overweight/obesity in children. Conclusions Our results suggested that the disrupted arginine and proline metabolism associated with phthalate exposure might contribute to the development of overweight and obesity in school-age children, providing insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms involved in childhood obesity.},

METHOD: Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, as well as PsycINFO were systematically retrieved for the records related to pesticide exposure during pregnancy and ASD and ADHD in offspring before August 30, 2022. The pesticide category, maternal age and window of exposure as the main subgroups were presented. RESULTS: 949 studies were initially identified, and 19 studies were eventually included. Eleven were on ASD, seven were on ADHD, and one was on both disorders. Maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to ASD (pooled OR~=~1.19 (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.36)) and ADHD (pooled OR~=~1.20 (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.38)) in offspring. In the subgroup analysis, organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) (pooled OR~=~1.14 (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.24)), pyrethroid (pooled OR~=~1.40 (95\%CI: 1.09 to 1.80)), and maternal age ≥30 years old (pooled OR~=~1.24 (95\%CI: 1.10 to 1.40)) increased the risk of ASD in offspring. Maternal organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) exposure was a risk factor for ADHD in offspring (pooled OR~=~1.22 (95\%CI: 1.03 to 1.45)). CONCLUSION: Maternal pesticide exposure increased the risk of ASD and ADHD in offspring. Moreover, OPs, pyrethroid, and maternal age ≥30 years old were found to be risk factors affecting children's ASD. Maternal exposure to OCPs increased the risk of ADHD in offspring. Our findings contribute to our understanding of health risks related to maternal pesticide exposure and indicate that the in utero developmental period is a vulnerable window-of-susceptibility for ASD and ADHD risk in offspring. These findings should guide policies that limit maternal exposure to pesticides, especially for pregnant women living in agricultural areas.},

RESULTS: Median (IQR) homocysteine concentration and mean (SD) birthweight were 8.6 µmol/l (6.7,10.8) and 2642\,g (379) in the PMNS and 6.0 µmol/l (5.1,7.1) and 2871\,g (443) in the Parthenon study. Offspring birthweight was inversely related to maternal homocysteine concentration-PMNS: -22\,g/SD [95\% confidence interval (CI): (-50, 5), adjusted for gestational age and offspring gender]; Parthenon: -57\,g (-92, -21); meta-analysis: -40\,g (-62, -17)]. Maternal risk genotype at rs1801133 predicted higher homocysteine concentration [PMNS: 0.30 SD/allele (0.14, 0.46); Parthenon: 0.21 SD (0.02, 0.40); meta-analysis: 0.26 SD (0.14, 0.39)]; and lower birthweight [PMNS: -46\,g (-102, 11, adjusted for gestational age, offspring gender and rs1801133 genotype); Parthenon: -78\,g (-170, 15); meta-analysis: -61\,g (-111, -10)]. Instrumental variable and triangulation analysis supported a causal association between maternal homocysteine concentration and offspring birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a causal role for maternal homocysteine (1-C metabolism) in fetal growth. Reducing maternal homocysteine concentrations may improve fetal growth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insomnia is common and associated with adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in observational studies. However, those associations could be vulnerable to residual confounding or reverse causality. Our aim was to estimate the association of insomnia with stillbirth, miscarriage, gestational diabetes (GD), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), perinatal depression, preterm birth (PTB), and low/high offspring birthweight (LBW/HBW). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) with 81 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) instrumenting for a lifelong predisposition to insomnia. Our outcomes included ever experiencing stillbirth, ever experiencing miscarriage, GD, HDP, perinatal depression, PTB (gestational age {$<$}37 completed weeks), LBW ({$<$}2,500 grams), and HBW ({$>$}4,500 grams). We used data from women of European descent (N = 356,069, mean ages at delivery 25.5 to 30.0 years) from UK Biobank (UKB), FinnGen, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Born in Bradford (BiB), and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort (MoBa). Main MR analyses used inverse variance weighting (IVW), with weighted median and MR-Egger as sensitivity analyses. We compared MR estimates with multivariable regression of insomnia in pregnancy on outcomes in ALSPAC (N = 11,745). IVW showed evidence of an association of genetic susceptibility to insomnia with miscarriage (odds ratio (OR): 1.60, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 2.17, p = 0.002), perinatal depression (OR 3.56, 95\% CI: 1.49, 8.54, p = 0.004), and LBW (OR 3.17, 95\% CI: 1.69, 5.96, p {$<$} 0.001). IVW results did not support associations of insomnia with stillbirth, GD, HDP, PTB, and HBW, with wide CIs including the null. Associations of genetic susceptibility to insomnia with miscarriage, perinatal depression, and LBW were not observed in weighted median or MR-Egger analyses. Results from these sensitivity analyses were directionally consistent with IVW results for all outcomes, with the exception of GD, perinatal depression, and PTB in MR-Egger. Multivariable regression showed associations of insomnia at 18 weeks of gestation with perinatal depression (OR 2.96, 95\% CI: 2.42, 3.63, p {$<$} 0.001), but not with LBW (OR 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.69, 1.24, p = 0.60). Multivariable regression with miscarriage and stillbirth was not possible due to small numbers in index pregnancies. Key limitations are potential horizontal pleiotropy (particularly for perinatal depression) and low statistical power in MR, and residual confounding in multivariable regression. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed some evidence in support of a possible causal relationship between genetically predicted insomnia and miscarriage, perinatal depression, and LBW. Our study also found observational evidence in support of an association between insomnia in pregnancy and perinatal depression, with no clear multivariable evidence of an association with LBW. Our findings highlight the importance of healthy sleep in women of reproductive age, though replication in larger studies, including with genetic instruments specific to insomnia in pregnancy are important.},

As importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of endocrine disruptors can induce fatal disorders including obesity and cancer. Using diverse biological tools, the potential molecular mechanisms related with these diseases by exposure of endocrine disruptors. Recently, pathway analysis, a bioinformatics tool, is being widely used to predict the potential mechanism or biological network of certain chemicals. In this review, we initially summarize the major molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of the above mentioned diseases by endocrine disruptors. Additionally, we provide the potential markers and signaling mechanisms discovered via pathway analysis under exposure to representative endocrine disruptors, bisphenol, diethylhexylphthalate, and nonylphenol. The review emphasizes the importance of pathway analysis using bioinformatics to finding the specific mechanisms of toxic chemicals, including endocrine disruptors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this work was to examine whether the positive association between birth weight and childhood cognitive ability is seen within siblings from the same family, as well as between nonsiblings, and to determine whether these associations vary with age.METHODS. We compared the association of birth weight with cognitive ability measured at ages 5 to 6, 7 to 9, and 11 to 12 years among a total of 5402 children from different families with that among 2236 to 3083 sibships from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979-Children.RESULTS. In the whole cohort, there were positive associations between birth weight and cognitive ability at all ages, with the association increasing with age from a 0.81-point increase at ages 5 to 6 years to 1.30 and 1.44 points at ages 7 to 9 and 11 to 12 years, respectively, per 1 SD of gestational age- and gender-adjusted birth weight z score. With adjustment for covariates, there was marked attenuation of these associations. Mean differences were 0.28 points in children aged 5 to 6 years, 0.67 points in those aged 7 to 9 years, and 0.52 points in those aged 11 to 12 years after adjusting for child's gender, race or ethnicity, year of birth, and age at test; maternal age, height, parity, education, smoking during pregnancy, and cognitive ability; and household income. Our family-based analyses that separated within- and between-family effects found that the between-family associations were much stronger than the within-family associations. However, adjustment for potential confounders attenuated the between-family associations, and there was no evidence for a difference in association comparing the between- and within-family associations.CONCLUSIONS. In these data, the positive association between birth weight and childhood cognitive ability at ages 5 to 12 years is explained largely by family characteristics rather than a specific intrauterine effect.},

  abstract = {Background Pregnant women are exposed to a number of pesticides which are widely used in China. Their potential risks on reproduction and infants are still unknown. Objective We aimed to investigate whether infant's birth weight and length of gestation were associated with levels of various pesticides in maternal blood based on Nanjing Medical University (NMU) affiliated hospitals data and meta-analysis, and also to explore the possible intermediate metabolomics pathways. Methods Eligible subjects (n~=~102) were included in this study from the affiliated hospitals of NMU. Gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (QE) were used to detect 37 pesticides (9 organophosphorus pesticides, 7 organochlorine pesticides, 5 carbamate pesticides, and 16 others) and 161 metabolites (53 in animo acid metabolism 47 in lipid metabolism, 18 in carbohydrate metabolism, 14 in nucleotide metabolism and 29 in other metabolisms) in maternal blood, respectively. Multi-linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were performed to identify the association of single/mixed pesticide exposure in maternal blood with birth weight and length of gestation. Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis including additional 2497 subjects to evaluate whether exposure to key pesticide, β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) was associated with decreased birth weight globally. Mediation analysis was used to explore the metabolic alteration mediating the association between key pesticide exposure and birth outcomes. Results We found that decreased birth weight was significantly associated with increasing levels of mecarbam and β-HCH. We did not find any association between length of gestation and these pesticides. Among pesticides with detection rate more than 50\%, BKMR analysis found an overall negative association of mixed pesticides exposure with birth weight, and verified that β-HCH was the key pesticide for such effect. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative association between exposure to β-HCH and birth weight. Metabolomics identified three metabolites and five metabolites as significant mediators for the effect of mecarbam and β-HCH, respectively, among which glyceraldehyde and its related glycerolipid metabolism and thyroxine and its related thyroid hormone metabolism were found to be the mostly enriched mediating metabolic pathway. Conclusions Based on the comprehensive pesticide exposome and metabolome wide associational study combined with meta-analysis, we found that prenatal exposure to β-HCH and mecarbam decreased birth weight via disrupting thyroid hormone metabolism and glyceraldehyde metabolism, providing new insights into the toxic effects of exposure to pesticides on birth outcomes.},

  abstract = {Intelligence predicts important life and health outcomes, but the biological mechanisms underlying differences in intelligence are not yet understood. The use of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in human complex traits has been recently proposed. However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence. The standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for the primary MR analysis and three additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO) were used for sensitivity analyses. Using 25 genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), our study found that 5-oxoproline was associated with better performance in human intelligence tests (PIVW = 9.25 × 10–5). The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were applied (PMR-Egger = 0.0001, PWeighted median = 6.29 × 10–6, PMR-PRESSO = 0.0007), and repeated analysis yielded consistent result (PIVW = 0.0087). Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence. Our study provides novel insight by integrating genomics and metabolomics to estimate causal effects of genetically determined metabolites on human intelligence, which help to understanding of the biological mechanisms related to human intelligence.},

  abstract = {Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) remain one of the most commonly used pesticides, and their detection rates and residues in agricultural products, foods and environmental samples have been underestimated. Humans and environmental organisms are at high risk of exposure to OPs. Most OPs can be degraded and metabolized into dialkyl phosphates (DAPs) in organisms and the environment, and can be present in urine as biomarkers for exposure to OPs, of which diethyl phosphate (DEP) is a high-exposure metabolite. Epidemiological and cohort studies have found that DAPs are associated with endocrine hormone disorders, especially sex hormone disorders and thyroid hormone disorders, but there has been no direct causal evidence to support these findings. Our study explored the effects of chronic exposure to DEP on endocrine hormones and related metabolic indicators in adult male rats at actual doses that can be reached in the human body. The results showed that chronic exposure to DEP could cause thyroid-related hormone disorders in the serum of rats, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism in rats, and could also lead to abnormal expression of thyroid hormone-related genes in the rat liver. However, DEP exposure did not seem to affect serum sex hormone levels, spermatogenesis or sperm quality in rats. The molecular interactions between DEP and thyroid hormone-related enzymes/proteins were investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods in silico. It was found that DEP could strongly interact with thyroid hormone biosynthesis, blood transport, receptor binding and metabolism-related enzymes/proteins, interfering with the production and signal regulation of thyroid hormones. In vivo and in silico experiments showed that DEP might be a potential thyroid hormone-disrupting chemical, and therefore, we need to be more cautious and rigorous regarding organophosphorus chemical exposure.},

  abstract = {Pesticides are widely used in the agricultural Central Valley region of California. Historically, this has included organophosphates (OPs), organochlorines (OCs), and pyrethroids (PYRs). This study aimed to identify perturbations of the serum metabolome in response to each class of pesticide and mutual associations between groups of metabolites and multiple pesticides. We conducted high-resolution metabolomic profiling of serum samples from 176 older adults living in the California Central Valley using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We estimated chronic pesticide exposure (from 1974 to year of blood draw) to OPs, OCs, and PYRs from ambient sources at homes and workplaces with a geographic information system (GIS)-based model. Based on partial least-squares regression and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with one or multiple pesticide classes, including mitochondrial energy metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Utilizing an integrative network approach, we found that the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway is a common pathway shared across all three pesticide classes. The disruptions of the serum metabolome suggested that chronic pesticide exposure might result in oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which have been previously implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Overall, our findings provided a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms of chronic pesticide toxicity, and, for the first time, our approach informs exposome research by moving from macrolevel population exposures to microlevel biologic responses.},

  abstract = {Ideally, randomized trials would be used to compare the long-term effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes on clinically relevant outcomes. However, because randomized trials are not always feasible or timely, we often must rely on observational data to compare dynamic treatment regimes. An example of a dynamic treatment regime is "start combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) within 6 months of CD4 cell count first dropping below x cells/mm3 or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness, whichever happens first" where x can take values between 200 and 500. Recently, Cain et al (2011) used inverse probability (IP) weighting of dynamic marginal structural models to find the x that minimizes 5-year mortality risk under similar dynamic regimes using observational data. Unlike standard methods, IP weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders (e.g., CD4 cell count, viral load) that are affected by prior treatment. Here we describe an alternative method to IP weighting for comparing the effectiveness of dynamic cART regimes: the parametric g-formula. The parametric g-formula naturally handles dynamic regimes and, like IP weighting, can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders. However, estimators based on the parametric g-formula are more efficient than IP weighted estimators. This is often at the expense of more parametric assumptions. Here we describe how to use the parametric g-formula to estimate risk by the end of a user-specified follow-up period under dynamic treatment regimes. We describe an application of this method to answer the "when to start" question using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

There may be many precise interventions that could achieve this range. In this paper we consider representative interventions. These are special cases of random dynamic interventions; interventions under which treatment at each time is assigned according to a random draw from a distribution that may depend on a subject's measured past. Estimators of risk under representative interventions on a time-varying treatment have previously been described based on g-estimation of structural nested cumulative failure time models. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach based on inverse probability weighting (IPW) of marginal structural models. In particular, we show that the risk under a representative intervention on a time-varying continuous treatment can be consistently estimated via computationally simple IPW methods traditionally used for deterministic static (i.e. "nonrandom" and "nondynamic") interventions for binary treatments. We present an application of IPW in this setting to estimate the 28-year risk of coronary heart disease under various representative interventions on lifestyle behaviors in the Nurses Health Study.},

  abstract = {Approximate statistical inference via determination of the asymptotic distribution of a statistic is routinely used for inference in applied medical statistics (e.g. to estimate the standard error of the marginal or conditional risk ratio). One method for variance estimation is the classical Delta-method but there is a knowledge gap as this method is not routinely included in training for applied medical statistics and its uses are not widely understood. Given that a smooth function of an asymptotically normal estimator is also asymptotically normally distributed, the Delta-method allows approximating the large-sample variance of a function of an estimator with known large-sample properties. In a more general setting, it is a technique for approximating the variance of a functional (i.e., an estimand) that takes a function as an input and applies another function to it (e.g. the expectation function). Specifically, we may approximate the variance of the function using the functional Delta-method based on the influence function (IF). The IF explores how a functional \$\textbackslash phi(\textbackslash theta)\$ changes in response to small perturbations in the sample distribution of the estimator and allows computing the empirical standard error of the distribution of the functional. The ongoing development of new methods and techniques may pose a challenge for applied statisticians who are interested in mastering the application of these methods. In this tutorial, we review the use of the classical and functional Delta-method and their links to the IF from a practical perspective. We illustrate the methods using a cancer epidemiology example and we provide reproducible and commented code in R and Python using symbolic programming.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalate have been detected widely in the environment; while several studies have indicated that prenatal phthalate exposure has adverse effects on neurodevelopment, the results were inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the current research status of the relationship between prenatal exposure to different types of phthalate and cognition and behavioral development in children. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the current state of knowledge. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE electronic databases up to May 2018 with manual searches of the references of retrieved publications and relevant reviews. Only birth cohort studies that reported on the association between phthalate exposure and cognitive or behavioral development were included in this review. We evaluated the risk of bias for each of the included studies using a modified instrument based on the Cochrane Collaboration's "Risk of Bias" tool. RESULT: Twenty-six birth cohort studies met our inclusion criteria, nine of which investigated the impact of phthalate exposure during pregnancy on cognition, 13 on neurobehavior, and 4 on both cognition and neurobehavior. However, ten articles reported that the effect of prenatal exposure to phthalates on cognitive development was statistically significant, 15 articles reported that the effect of prenatal exposure to phthalates on neurobehavior was statistically significant. The effect of prenatal phthalate exposure on neurodevelopment differed according to sex, but the results are inconsistent, for instance, among the five studies investigating the association between mental development index (MDI) and Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), two of them showed a significantly decreasing MDI scores with increasing concentrations of MnBP among girls, but among boys one study showed the inverse association, another showed the positive association. CONCLUSION: Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, butyl-benzyl phthalate and di-ethyl phthalate exposure during pregnancy was associated with lower cognitive scores and worse behavior in offspring, and sex-specific effects on cognitive, psychomotor, and behavioral development were identified, especially the impact of phthalate exposure on neurobehavior in boys.},

  abstract = {It is well known that inappropriate exposure to exogenous hormones during fetal or neonatal life, such as testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2), leads to adverse reproductive outcomes. In our previous study, the reproductive dysfunction of male rats was characterized by an E2 increase and T decrease after in utero and lactation exposures to n-butylparaben (n-BP). In this study, we investigated the synthesis and metabolism pathways of steroid hormones, hormone receptors and the epigenetic modification of male offspring on postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND90 to explore the possible mechanisms of endocrine and reproductive disorders. The expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1) and androgen receptor (AR) in the testes was significantly decreased at the transcript and protein levels; in addition, aromatase (CYP19) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression was significantly increased and the methylation rate of the ERα promoter was significantly decreased. These results suggest that increased CYP19 expression and decreased SULT1E1 expression are responsible for the E2 increase. This effect promotes the expression of ERα, which plays a pivotal role in regulating reproductive and endocrine disorders of male rats exposed to n-BP. Furthermore, the epigenetic hypomethylation of ERα is involved in this regulation processes. Our study is the first to report on the possible mechanism of male rat reproductive disorders induced by the xenoestrogenic chemical n-BP. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We investigated the relationship between household exposure to pesticides and childhood AL. Between 2009 and 2010 in Shanghai, a total of 248 newly diagnosed cases of AL and 111 gender-, age-, and hospital-matched controls were included. Five nonspecific dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) [including dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP)] in the urine were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the median DMP, DEP, DMTP, DETP, and DEDEP levels adjusted for creatinine (Cr) in cases (13.2, 10.0, 31.3, 8.5, and 6.1 μg g(-1), respectively) were all significantly elevated compared with those in controls (3.6, 3.6, 13.3, 2.7, and 1.7 μg g(-1), respectively) (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). The household use of mosquito repellent was significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood AL (odds ratio (OR)\,=\,1.9; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.1). Moreover, higher exposures were significantly associated with an elevated risk of childhood AL for DMs, DEs, and DAPs. Our findings support the notion that the household use of pesticides may play a role in the etiology of childhood AL and provide some evidence to warrant further investigation of the link between household pesticide exposures and childhood AL in Shanghai.},

  abstract = {The general population is exposed to phthalates through various sources and routes. Integration of omics data and epidemiological data is a key step toward directly linking phthalate biomonitoring data with biological response. Urine metabolomics is a powerful tool to identify exposure biomarkers and delineate the modes of action of environmental stressors. The objectives of this study are to investigate the association between low-level environmental phthalate exposure and urine metabolome alteration in male population, and to unveil the metabolic pathways involved in the mechanisms of phthalate toxicity. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we studied the urine metabolomic profiles of 364 male subjects exposed to low-level environmental phthalates. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are the most widely used phthalates. ∑DEHP and MBP (the major metabolite of DBP) were associated with significant alteration of global urine metabolome in the male population. We observed significant increase in the levels of acetylneuraminic acid, carnitine C8:1, carnitine C18:0, cystine, phenylglycine, phenylpyruvic acid and glutamylphenylalanine; and meanwhile, decrease in the levels of carnitine C16:2, diacetylspermine, alanine, taurine, tryptophan, ornithine, methylglutaconic acid, hydroxyl-PEG2 and keto-PGE2 in high exposure group. The observations indicated that low-level environmental phthalate exposure associated with increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation and decreased prostaglandin metabolism. Urea cycle, tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism disruption was also observed. The urine metabolome disruption effects associated with ∑DEHP and MBP were similar, but not identical. The multibiomarker models presented AUC values of 0.845 and 0.834 for ∑DEHP and MBP, respectively. The predictive accuracy rates of established models were 81\% for ΣDEHP and 73\% for MBP. Our results suggest that low-level environmental phthalate exposure associates with urine metabolome disruption in male population, providing new insight into the early molecular events of phthalate exposure.},

DATA SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: Patients with end-stage renal disease from the US Renal Data System who had congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease and were undergoing hemodialysis in outpatient dialysis facilities between 2006 and 2010. STUDY DESIGN: We explicitly emulated a target trial of three ‎erythropoietin dosing strategies (aimed at achieving a low, middle, or high hematocrit) and estimated the observational analog of the per-protocol effect. RESULTS: Of 156,945 eligible patients, 41,970 died during the 18-month follow-up. Compared to the low-hematocrit strategy, the estimated risk of death was 4.6 (95\% CI 4.4-4.9) percentage points higher under the high-hematocrit strategy and 1.8 (95\% CI 1.7-1.9) percentage points higher under the mid-hematocrit strategy. The corresponding risk differences for a composite outcome of death and myocardial infarction were similar. CONCLUSION: An explicit emulation of a target trial using electronic health records, combined with the parametric g-formula, allowed comparison of real-world dynamic strategies that have not been compared in randomized trials.},

Thus, those exposures may be modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease. Some of the chemicals, such as Perfluoroalkyl acid (PFA), are pervasive throughout our environment, determining their health effects is an important public health concern. In this study, we examined cross-sectional data from the 2009-2010 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) using a statistical causal inference method-generalized propensity score method, to determine the links between concentrations of several major environmental chemicals and kidney function measured by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Various generalized propensity score estimation methods including Hirano-Imbens, additive spline, and a generalized additive model were compared. Among the examined environmental chemicals, each of the statistical models used associated an increase in PFA concentration with a decline in eGFR. We conclude that PFA is a modifiable risk factor for chronic kidney disease and the statistical causal method produces credible results in estimating the effect of chemical exposures on a continuous measure of kidney functions with an observational dataset.},

In this study, three parabens were determined in the urine samples of 88 pregnant women by using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ MS). The samples were divided into different groups based on tertile distribution of urinary paraben concentrations. Metabolic profiling of the 88 urine samples was performed by using UHPLC coupled with Orbitrap high-resolution MS. Differential metabolites were screened by comparing the profiles of urine samples from different paraben-exposure groups. The identified metabolites included purines, acylcarnitines, etc., revealing that metabolic pathways such as purine metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and other pathways were disturbed by parabens. Eighteen and three metabolites were correlated (Spearman correlation analysis, p {$<$} 0.05) with the exposure levels of methyparaben and propylparaben, respectively. This is the first MS-based nontargeted metabolomics study on pregnant women with paraben exposure. The findings reveal the potential health risk of exposure to parabens and might help one to understand the link between paraben exposure and some metabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors and found in almost all people with several associated adverse health outcomes reported in humans and animal models. Limited data are available on the relationship between exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and the human metabolome. We examined the relationship of metabolomic profiles in plasma and urine of 115 pregnant women with eleven urine phthalate metabolites measured at 26 weeks of gestation to identify potential biomarkers and relevant pathways. Targeted metabolomics was performed by selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry to measure 415 metabolites in plasma and 151 metabolites in urine samples. We have chosen metabolites with the best defined peaks for more detailed analysis (138 in plasma and 40 in urine). Relationship between urine phthalate metabolites and concurrent metabolomic markers in plasma and urine suggested potential involvement of diverse pathways including lipid, steroid, and nucleic acid metabolism and enhanced inflammatory response. Most of the correlations were positive for both urine and plasma, and further confirmed by regression and PCA analysis. However, after the FDR adjustment for multiple comparisons, only 9 urine associations remained statistically significant (q-values 0.0001–0.0451), including Nicotinamide mononucleotide, Cysteine T2, Cystine, and L-Aspartic acid. Additionally, we found negative associations of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) with more than 20 metabolomic markers related to lipid and amino-acid metabolism and inflammation pathways in plasma (p = 0.01–0.0004), while Mevalonic acid was positively associated (p = 0.009). Nicotinic acid, the only significant metabolite in urine, had a positive association with maternal BMI (p = 0.002). In summary, when evaluated in the context of metabolic pathways, the findings suggest enhanced lipid biogenesis, inflammation and altered nucleic acid metabolism in association with higher phthalate levels. These results provide new insights into the relationship between phthalates, common in most human populations, and metabolomics, a novel approach to exposure and health biomonitoring.},

We measured urinary levels of nine phthalate metabolites using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We estimated the associations of individual phthalate metabolite with blood lipid traits by linear mixed effect (LME) models, and assessed the overall association of the mixture of nine phthalate metabolites with blood lipid traits using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models. LME models revealed the negative association of urinary mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) with total cholesterol (TC) as well as of urinary mono-benzyl phthalate or urinary MEHP with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). BKMR models revealed the negative overall association of the mixture of nine phthalate metabolites with TC or LDL-C, and DEHP metabolites (especially MEHP) had a greater contribution to TC or LDL-C levels than non-DEHP metabolites. The findings indicated the negative overall association of the mixture of nine phthalate metabolites with TC or LDL-C. Among nine phthalate metabolites, MEHP was the most important component for the changes of TC or LDL-C levels, implying that phthalates exposure may disrupt lipid metabolism in the body.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and creates a significant burden on society. As a result, the investigation of hub genes for the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers is warranted. In this study, we used the ComBat method to merge three gene expression datasets of AD from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). During combined analysis, we identified 850 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the temporal cortex of AD and cognitively normal (CN) samples. We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis to build gene coexpression networks incorporating these DEGs to identify key modules and hub genes. We found one module most strongly correlated with AD onset as the key module and 19 hub genes in the key module that were down-regulated in AD brains. According to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, DEGs were mostly enriched in synapse function, and genes in the key module were mostly related to learning and memory. We selected five little-studied genes, AP3B2, GABRD, GPR158, KIAA0513, and MAL2, to validate their expression in AD mouse model by performing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that all of them were down-regulated in cortices of 8-month 5xFAD mice compared to those of wild-type mice. We then further investigated their correlations with β-secretase activity and Aβ42 levels in AD samples of different Braak stages. We found that all five hub genes had significant negative associations with β-secretase activity and that AP3B2 and KIAA0513 had significant negative associations with Aβ42 levels. We tested the differential expressions of the five hub genes in two AD GEO datasets from the blood and found that KIAA0513 was significantly up-regulated in patients with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and was able to differentiate MCI and AD from CN in the two datasets. In conclusion, these five novel vulnerable genes were involved in AD progression, and KIAA0513 was a promising candidate biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract = {Objective This study aims to explore the relationship between urinary phthalate metabolites and total and specific cardiovascular disease (CVD) among the general adult population. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed 11 urinary phthalates in the general population from the 2005–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n~=~10,427). Multivariate logistic regression and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression were applied to examine the relationship between phthalate metabolites and mixtures and the prevalence rates of total and specific CVD. Results Compared to the lowest quartile, mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) (OR 1.37; 95\% CI 1.03–1.83, P for trend~=~0.032) and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) (OR 1.44; 95\% CI 1.10–1.88, P for trend~=~0.013) in the highest quartile were independently associated with increased total CVD. The WQS index of phthalate mixtures was independently correlated with total CVD (adjusted OR 1.17; 95\% CI 1.01–1.36, P~=~0.039), and MBzP (weight~=~0.392) was the most heavily weighted component. In addition, restricted cubic spline regression demonstrated that the MBzP level had a positive correlation and linear association with total CVD (P for nonlinearity~=~0.182). Conclusions Our findings suggest that high phthalate mixture levels are associated with an increased prevalence of CVD, with the greatest influence coming from MBzP.},

  abstract = {Although association studies have unveiled numerous correlations of biochemical markers with age and age-related diseases, we still lack an understanding of their mutual dependencies. To find molecular pathways that underlie age-related diseases as well as their comorbidities, we integrated aging markers from four different high-throughput omics datasets, namely epigenomics, transcriptomics, glycomics and metabolomics, with a comprehensive set of disease phenotypes from 510 participants of the TwinsUK cohort. We used graphical random forests to assess conditional dependencies between omics markers and phenotypes while eliminating mediated associations. Applying this novel approach for multi-omics data integration yields a model consisting of seven modules that represent distinct aspects of aging. These modules are connected by hubs that potentially trigger comorbidities of age-related diseases. As an example, we identified urate as one of these key players mediating the comorbidity of renal disease with body composition and obesity. Body composition variables are in turn associated with inflammatory IgG markers, mediated by the expression of the hormone oxytocin. Thus, oxytocin potentially contributes to the development of chronic low-grade inflammation, which often accompanies obesity. Our multi-omics graphical model demonstrates the interconnectivity of age-related diseases and highlights molecular markers of the aging process that might drive disease comorbidities.},

  abstract = {The accompanying article by Keil et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2021;190(12):2647–2657) deploys Bayesian g-computation to investigate the causal effect of 6 airborne metal exposures linked to power-plant emissions on birth weight. In so doing, it articulates the potential value of framing the analysis of environmental mixtures as an explicit contrast between exposure distributions that might arise in response to a well-defined intervention—here, the decommissioning of coal plants. Framing the mixture analysis as that of an approximate “target trial” is an important approach that deserves incorporation into the already rich literature on the analysis of environmental mixtures. However, its deployment in the power plant example highlights challenges that can arise when the target trial is at odds with the exposure distribution observed in the data, a discordance that seems particularly difficult in studies of environmental mixtures. Bayesian methodology such as model averaging and informative priors can help, but they are ultimately limited for overcoming this salient challenge.},

  abstract = {Dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) are primarily industrially produced and remain abundant in processed food, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Although TFAs are a cause of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes, little is known about exposure to TFAs in relation to brain development. We aimed to investigate the effect of maternal TFA concentration during pregnancy on offspring head growth in utero and during childhood. In a prospective population-based study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with 6900 mother–child dyads, maternal plasma TFA concentration was assessed using gas chromatography in mid-gestation. Offspring head circumference (HC) was measured in the second and third trimesters using ultrasonography; childhood brain morphology was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging at age 10~years. We performed regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders and instrumental variable (IV) analyses. Our IV analysis leveraged a national policy change that led to a substantial reduction in TFA and occurred mid-recruitment. After adjusting for covariates, maternal TFA concentration during pregnancy was inversely related to fetal HC in the third trimester (mean difference per 1\% wt:wt increase:\,−\,0.33, 95\% CI\,−\,0.51,\,−\,0.15, cm) and to fetal HC growth from the second to the third trimester (−\,0.04, 95\% CI\,−\,0.06,\,−\,0.02, cm/week). Consistent findings were obtained with IV analyses, strengthening a causal interpretation. Association between prenatal TFA exposure and HC in the second trimester or global brain volume at age 10~years was inconclusive. Our findings are of important public health relevance as TFA levels in food remain high in many countries.},
